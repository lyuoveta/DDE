" September 7, 2023", United States ,5,Hunter bottoms,Love these,"I recently started taking NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU, and it has made a noticeable difference in my overall well-being.

The high potency of 5,000 IU per softgel is fantastic, especially for those who may have a Vitamin D deficiency. I appreciate the fact that one softgel provides a significant portion of the daily recommended intake, making it easy to ensure I'm getting enough Vitamin D.

The softgels are easy to swallow, and they don't leave any unpleasant aftertaste. This makes it a hassle-free addition to my daily supplement routine.

I've noticed a positive impact on my mood and energy levels since incorporating this supplement. Vitamin D is crucial for various bodily functions, including immune system support and bone health, and this product delivers in that regard.

The 240-count bottle is excellent value for the price. It lasts for a long time, so I don't have to worry about running out of Vitamin D supplements.

Overall, NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU is a high-quality product that I would recommend to anyone looking to boost their Vitamin D levels. It's convenient, effective, and offers great value for the quantity provided. It's become a staple in my supplement regimen."
" December 7, 2023", United States ,5,BELOH2O,Small and powerful,I‚Äôm on my second bottle of these they‚Äôre nice and small and loaded with vitamin D. This is a reliable company so I pretty much only buy from them and a few others but I‚Äôm always pleased with NOW. They always have great prices too!
" November 16, 2023", United States ,5,Chuck,Good value for product,"What I like is the high potency for a small pill that is easily swallowed. Many other brands have reviews where the pills are all stuck together, these pills don't have that issue. They are all separable. The Now brand is cheaper than others so I was worried about quality. I saw one reviewer mention that they were informed by someone in the industry that they are pretty good so I went for it. Sure enough, pretty good."

" September 28, 2023", United States ,4,Sb,all seem to work the same,"I need to take vitamin D due to low levels in my body. It serves its purpose, is easy to swallow and the price was reasonable. This bottle that I purchased in 2023 had the expiration date of 2027. Since I take it daily I have no fear of using up the 120 pills in around 4 years time. I personally have not noticed a difference from one brand to another in my blood work."
" December 27, 2023", United States ,5,JAVIN SMITH,Works Great!,I love that it's made with olive oil and not a crappy seed oil. Small capsule and easy to swallow with no taste!
" January 2, 2024", United States ,5,Melissa Bennett,Great Value,This is a great cost. They work.
" December 23, 2023", United States ,5,Vadya Electrik,Vitamin D levels good,Very convenient vitamin D3 supplement. It contains a large dose of vitamin in a very tiny and easy to swallow pill. This vitamin needs to be taken with some fat to be better absorbed so the fact that this pill is oil based makes it perfect.
" January 7, 2024", United States ,5,Sara,Easy to Take and Bovine Gelatin,"These are the perfect size where it's not uncomfortable to take AT ALL and is one of the few D3s I could find that had Bovine gelatin (as opposed to pork, which we cannot have). You barely feel it, and it's kind of slippery so it doesn't get ""stuck,"" nor does it have a weird vitamin-y taste that bothers you for a while after. For these reasons, this is the D3 my family and I continue to repurchase."
" January 10, 2024", United States ,5,OldHippie,"Good product, inconsistent look.","I've purchased these for my hubby 3 times, and each time the pills look different. One time the gel cap is clear, next time they're white. Dr's tests show his levels are staying steady, so no complaints about the results, just a bit concerning when the look keeps changing. Makes me wonder why."
" January 16, 2024", United States ,4,Santonio Nelson,Take once a week,"I'm surprised the direction does not say to take these once a week. This is the strongest potency there is and it shouldn't be taken everyday nor for a long period. It can only be taken up to 6-8 weeks once per week. My first day of taken them I got a headache. Second week no headache, I think my body got used to the first capsule."

" December 24, 2023", United States ,5,Lillian K Allen,Really works,"My doctor asked after blood work why I was taking so much vitamin E. She suggested I back off. The assistant motioned to keep talking it! I heard that it is good and I continue to take 5,000 units a day."
" December 23, 2023", United States ,5,Cathy A.,"No taste, easy to swallow",Flavorless and easy to swallow. I take this after a meal with my vitamin B12 and I do not have an issue with being cold all the time anymore. My energy levels are higher and I have been sleeping better.

Note to self: Next time, consult a doctor, unless you're into surprise constipation parties. Spoiler alert: I wasn't.

These golden nuggets of ""structural support"" turned out to be more like rebellious architects staging a coup in my digestive system. Forget about feeling the sunshine; I was stuck in a cloud of discomfort.

Now, did I experience any life-altering revelations during this constipation escapade? Nope. These softgels didn't transform me into a health god; they just made me question my life choices while glued to the porcelain throne.

In the grand spectacle of my health journey, these softgels decided to add a plot twist. ""Sure, boost your Vitamin D levels,"" they whispered, ""but we're also here to keep things interesting, like a dysfunctional reality show for your gut.""

So, if you're in the market for a supplement that turns your daily routine into a bathroom drama, NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU might just be your quirky sidekick. As for me, I'm off to consult professionals before embarking on any more gut-wrenching adventures. Here's to health, humor, and the uncharted territories of constipation comedy!"

" November 21, 2012", United States ,5,Marsha Lynne,Vitamin D-3,"itamin D3 deficiency is common in older adults and has been implicated in psychiatric and neurologic disorders. For example, in one study of 80 older adults (40 with mild Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and 40 nondemented persons), Vitamin D3 deficiency was associated with low mood and with impairment on two of four measures of cognitive performance.6

Back Pain

Musculoskeletal disorders have been linked to Vitamin D3 deficiency in a number of studies. One of the newest studies explored the role that low Vitamin D3 levels play in the development of chronic low back pain in women. Sixty female patients in Egypt complaining of low back pain lasting more than three months were studied. Researchers measured levels of Vitamin D3 in the women with low back pain and compared those levels to those of 20 matched healthy controls.

The study revealed that patients with low back pain had significantly lower Vitamin D3 levels than controls. Low Vitamin D3 levels (25 OHD < 40 ng/ml) were found in 49/60 patients (81 percent) and 12/20 (60 percent) of controls.7

Bone Health

One of the best known and long-established benefits of Vitamin D3 is its ability to improve bone health and the health of the musculoskeletal system. It is well documented that Vitamin D3 deficiency causes osteopenia, precipitates and exacerbates osteoporosis, causes a painful bone disease known as osteomalacia, and exacerbates muscle weakness, which increases the risk of falls and fractures. Vitamin D3 insufficiency may alter the regulatory mechanisms of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and cause a secondary hyperparathyroidism that increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.8

Cognitive Enhancement

Scientists are developing a greater appreciation for Vitamin D3‚Äôs ability to improve cognition. In a recent study, Vitamin D3 deficient subjects scored worse on mental function tests compared to individuals who had higher levels of the Vitamin.9 The researchers wrote, ‚ÄúIn conclusion, the positive, significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D concentration and MMSE [mental state examination scores] in these patients suggests a potential role for Vitamin D in cognitive function of older adults.‚Äù

Immunity

Scientists have linked various aspects of immune health to a Vitamin D3 deficiency. Vitamin D3 regulates T cells, which are important to the functioning of a strong immune system. Vitamin D3 acts as an immune system modulator, preventing excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines and increasing the killing efficiency of macrophages. In addition, it dramatically stimulates the expression of potent anti-microbial peptides, which exist in immune system cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and in cells lining the respiratory tract. These Vitamin-D3-stimulated peptides play a major role in protecting the lung from infection.13

In addition, Vitamin D3 deficiency may influence development and progression of various autoimmune diseases.14

Multi-Talented Nutrient

Vitamin D3 deficiency has been linked to a host of other conditions such as high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and an increased risk of pre-eclampsia and insulin resistance during pregnancy.11,15-16 Most recently, low Vitamin D3 levels have been linked to an increased prevalence of early age-related macular degeneration.17

Proper Dosage

In many of my patients, even after consuming 2,000 to 4,000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day, their test results indicate that their Vitamin D3 levels have not increased. These patients needed to consume 8,000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day to achieve proper blood levels of the Vitamin. Patients should, therefore, have their physicians test their serum 1,25-dihyroxy D3 levels to determine the proper level of supplementation required. Testing is very important due to the fact that, in a small number of patients, Vitamin D3 supplementation can raise calcium levels to an excessively high level. I have found this to be especially true in African American patients. Testing for 1,25-dihyroxy Vitamin D3, PTH and calcium blood levels should therefore become a part of every woman‚Äôs regular blood work.

Conclusion

A growing number of researchers who have widely studied Vitamin D3 are almost begging the general public to consume more of this important nutrient. Due to Vitamin D3‚Äôs high safety profile in doses up to 10,000 IU per day and because of the wide role it plays in our health, consuming 2,000 to 4,000 IU per day of this nutrient at times of the year when sunlight is scarce is a prudent way to improve overall health."

" November 11, 2017", United States ,5,MD,Because the MK-7 from Natto makes me itch like crazy and makes me feel sick,"It seems that 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 will raise your blood levels by 5 ng/mL. At least in my case.

My Vitamin D level was 18 ng/mL. I took 20,000 UI of Vitamin D for 2 weeks and then I increase it to 40,000 UI for 4 weeks and my levels went up to 136.3 ng/mL. The reference range for Vitamin D is 30-80 ng/mL (this is the normal-range lower and upper limits) so my levels were HIGH. An increase of about 3 ng/mL per 1,000 UI of Vitamin D supplementation in a very short period of time so if I took it for longer (8 weeks) I will guess it will be a lot higher. I took that much because I am supposed to not be able to absorb it because I am supposedly not generation enough stomach acid and taking ursodiol which affects the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, I was wrong‚Ä¶

When I was taking a supplement with 2,000 UI of Vitamin D my level was 30 ng/mL when I stopped taking it my level went down to 18 ng/mL. An increase of about 5 ng/mL per 1,000 UI

I want to be at 70 ng/mL (which is the hight end of the optimal level) because I have autoimmune thyroid disease and autoimmune gastritis. So to go from 18 ng/mL to 70 ng/mL (raise my levels by 50), I should have taken 10,000 IU of Vitamin D and not 40,000 IU as I did.

Just in case you did not know, the Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) you take is converted by the liver into calcifediol (a prehormone) also know as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This is the substance that is measure when you take a vitamin D test. So if your liver is not working properly or you are taking medicines that affect the liver your absorption will vary. After it is converted by the liver, it then needs to be converted to the active form our body can use and this is done by the kidneys. The active form is called calcitriol. So again if you kidneys are not working well, your blood levels might be high but you are in reality still deficient because your kidneys can‚Äôt convert it to the active form. There is a test to measure calcitriol too but is not given often.

I am going to start taking 10,000 UI now along with Vitamin K2 but I will wait 10 days as my levels are too high now.

Vitamin K2 is a must if you are going to maintain your vitamin-D Levels in the high end of the optimal range. I use the Menatetrenone (also know as MK-4 form) form of Vitamin K2 (check Wikipedia). Why? Because the MK-7 from Natto makes me itch like crazy and makes me feel sick. Also, Menatetrenone/MK-4 is the type use in Japan to treat osteoporosis. I am using the Thorne brand and I buy it here in amazon. Just in case you are curious the dosage to treat osteoporosis with Vitamin K2 (as Menatetrenone) in Japan is 15 mg, three times daily. That is exactly the high end of the suggested dosage mention in Thorne Vitamin K2 Liquid. I only wish Thorne had a softgel form of this supplement so I can place it in my pill holder. Carlson also makes this form of Vitamin K2 but is not liquid. It is a dry powder. I do not like that because K2 needs fat to be absorved and the Thorne brand is dissolved in Medium Chain Triglycerides (oil).

I am going to update this review at 8 weeks after I have my Vitamin D levels tested again."
" July 22, 2023", United States ,5,TamysThoughts,"Great supplement, especially if you have a deficiency","I believe these are the ones I got that are chewable or melts in your mouth you know sublingual, and if they are, they‚Äôre very tasty and they‚Äôre tiny and they do what they‚Äôre supposed to do. My vitamin D levels and calcium have come up but especially the vitamin D, it does what it supposed to get yourself some. Especially if you‚Äôre not someone who‚Äôs out in the sunlight often And I have a deficiency and I have to supplement but most people just need to the normal amount of dosage. Don‚Äôt overdo it get tested every time you have tested your doctors just to make sure your levels are correct anything you ever do can be harmful, so make sure you need it and then get these there a great price and the quality is excellent ."

" December 6, 2018", United States ,5,GIVE Reviews,Very important vitamin as we age," [+] WHITE GLOVE REVIEW w/ video
(To watch the video or upvote review goto: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24WTEVRR04JRA)
=>Vitamin D-3 is produced by the skin when exposed to sun light. As we age, our skin becomes less effective at producing this critical vitamin. I am an older person, so I could spend all day in the sun and still not be getting enough D-3. I take this to supplement my body to make sure I am getting enough D-3. I have read literature that follows a guideline of supplementing with around 2,000 IU after the age of 35 and around 5,000 IU after the age of 50. I follow this guideline, which is why I take 5,000 IU. There are many manufacturers now that sell D-3, and I am sure that many are good. I buy the NOW brand because I trust this company to give me the highest quality for the most reasonable price. I don‚Äôt buy everything from NOW Foods, because I assess each product as to what company I should buy from.

[+] INGREDIENTS
Active:
- Vitamin D3 as Cholecalciferol from Lanolin (125mg : 5000IU : 625%DV)
Other:
- Softgel Capsule (bovine gelatin, water, glycerin) and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

[+] WHAT TO EXPECT
Vitamin D-3 is not a vitamin that will give you an effect for the most part. I have heard about some people who find their skin to become softer or other such mild effects. But, for the most part, I take D-3 because my body needs it to function properly, not because any symptom I am having. Think of Vitamin D-3 like putting oil in your car. For the most part, even if your car is low in oil, it runs just fine. That‚Äôs why we check it with a dip stick otherwise who would know. But, if you run your car low in oil long enough, then symptoms will appear. However, then it‚Äôs too late. The damage to your car has already been done. That‚Äôs how I think about taking D-3. It‚Äôs something that needs to be maintained, but if it‚Äôs not, then your body will eventually break down in some way ‚Äì and as with the car, then its too late.

[+] USAGE/DOSE
The suggested usage (from the label) is to, ‚ÄúTake 1 softgel every 2 days with a fat-containing meal, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.‚Äù I take one softgel per day; however, there are days that I skip taking it. I am not advocating to deviate from the product‚Äôs suggested use; I am only conveying what I do. On average, I most likely take this product 4-5 times a week. If I forget to take this product (along with my multi-vitamin) for more than a couple of days, I usually take two the first day.

" July 7, 2022", United States ,5,KL,Extremely Important Vitamin D3 That‚Äôs Affordable!,"My Endocrinologist had advised that I needed to start taking a vitamin supplement after they had ran labs on me. It was found that my Vitamin D3 level was a bit below normal. I'm in my mid-years, and I used to be a very active person outside. But, as my life has changed over the years, I find myself spending more time inside now. As being as such, it wasn‚Äôt surprising to learn that my Vitamin D3 levels had begun to suffer. As directed by my doctor, I started taking one vitamin d3 supplement daily ‚Äî NOW brand softgels. After only about a month, low and behold, I was starting to feel better than I had in a really long time. I stated to have more energy, I wasn't falling asleep during the day anymore, and I was able to do my daily exercises with a bit more ease. My doctor ran those exact same labs again after I had taken almost the full bottle, my level was much higher than before. I was told it's going to take a while to get things back to normal, but I can definitely tell its working. NOW brand vitamin D3 supplement seems to be offered at a little better price than most others on the market. This is an amazing and affordable vitamin supplement that is easy to swallow by mouth and by your pocket financially. Always ask your doctor before deciding to start or stop a vitamin supplement regimen. Listening to my doctors about needing to take specific vitamin supplements has really turned my life around."

" August 8, 2023", United States ,5,Michael Brock,Possible vitamin d3 deficiencies,I've been in pain for so long. So joints and leg bone pain is unbearable at times. 2 orthopedic doctors tell me to get rotator cup surgery another doctor says it's with getting older each year. All these doctors give pain killers. None work. I found out just by going outside into the sunshine and taking this d3 supplements. The unbearable pain goes completely away. I still have pain from time to time. But the pain is becoming unnoticeable
" August 22, 2021", United States ,5,DR,Now is a great brand and 5000 the size for not small people - 4th bottles YES YES A++,"Vit D is essential to health. Sun isn't enough for ideal or all norther areas. Vit-D is a hormone that modulates over 100 genes and is essential for health. Poor Immune system is VERY CLOSELY TIED to low Vid-D.. Animals have a pathway to make their own. The UK has national health and thus GREAT DATA on 30 million people. Alarming Vit-D levels are seen in Northern areas.. 2016 peer reviewed study showed 70% the population are below IDEAL levels and 30% below target. DARK skin people blocks sunlight and they mostly below target levels. CLINICALLY DANGEROUS less than 10% of target is not uncommon. They take this seriously. Others studies show resistance to FLU's and especially repretory illness have HUGE Improvements. There are Studies for this years bug .. Look it up. It's a taboo subject here. Healthcare will not recommend above 1000iu because of the TINY people and a couple medical issues. LARGE weekly, monthly and 6 mo doses are HUGE by comparison and Given to massive people in many places. Levels dip in just 3 days so infrequent is less ideal.. No MD doctor in USA or UK would tell you taking 1 (5000iu) a week was dangerous. YMMV . do some research.
Before you complain.. FREE healthcare for USA> There is NO PROFIT in UK healthcare, people are paid poorly, facilities are beat up old buildings, safety is minimal, there are no lawsuits, CARE is RATIONED.. At a certain age you will not be treated for cancer and 20 other things. Low health or Years of life left score, you are maintenance only."

" December 10, 2023", United States ,3,Ciro,NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 - A Constipated Odyssey,"So, I thought I'd be all ""health ninja"" and grab NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU. Note to self: Next time, consult a doctor, unless you're into surprise constipation parties. Spoiler alert: I wasn't.

These golden nuggets of ""structural support"" turned out to be more like rebellious architects staging a coup in my digestive system. Forget about feeling the sunshine; I was stuck in a cloud of discomfort.

Now, did I experience any life-altering revelations during this constipation escapade? Nope. These softgels didn't transform me into a health god; they just made me question my life choices while glued to the porcelain throne.

In the grand spectacle of my health journey, these softgels decided to add a plot twist. ""Sure, boost your Vitamin D levels,"" they whispered, ""but we're also here to keep things interesting, like a dysfunctional reality show for your gut.""

So, if you're in the market for a supplement that turns your daily routine into a bathroom drama, NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU might just be your quirky sidekick. As for me, I'm off to consult professionals before embarking on any more gut-wrenching adventures. Here's to health, humor, and the uncharted territories of constipation comedy!"

I must to other brands of supplements that have the more normal twist-off plastic cap opening-and-closing that goes much smoother, nicer, better and easier for their elderly customers. Seems to me that NOW supplements would learn to acommodate their elderly customers in order to KEEP these former customers. Many of us who live in our 55+ gated communities would be grateful."
