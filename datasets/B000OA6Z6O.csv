" April 13, 2023", United States ,5,Er K.,"Treating my 1.5yo Cat, Ingo, w/ this for Stomatitis","This Product is Amazing! At 10ppm (parts per million), it is on the Lower side of this Type of Product, as there are other Colloidal Silver's w/ 500ppm (& up).

However, I started giving this to my Cat, Ingo, on Monday Morning, due to him Slowly becoming Darn near Anorexic due to the Pain & Inflammation in his Mouth, causing him to Hate how Food, so he wouldn't Eat to avoid the Pain. He used to LOVE his Food & would come Running! He was a Healthy 10Lbs, but right before he got Fixed at the Beginning of March, I Weighed him to Find that he was only a Whopping 7.5Lbs! When I took him to get Neutered, I asked the Intake Staff if they could ask the Vet/Surgeon to take a Peek at his Teeth while he was Sedated & Intubated to see if they could see a Broken Tooth or Infection, etc, bc the Water Additive & PlaqueOff wasn't making the Difference I'd Hoped for. Needless to say, the couldn't be bothered to quickly take a look to let Me know what was gong on. Then Due to the Pain Meds from his Surgery he was Gorging due to not Eating enough prior to his Neuter Surgery due to the Pain, but once it wore off he slowly reverted back to treating Food like the Enemy, but the Last Straw for me was when he started Hiding more & more, acting Reclusive, not Eating & Sleeping all Day. Definitely NOT the way most Cats his Age act & I knew I had to do something. I've had Cats & Dogs my Entire Life & NEVER heard of ""Stomatitis"", which in Layman's Terms is Inflammation of the Opening of the Mouth, such as the Gums (Not the Stomach): ""Stoma"" means ""Opening of"" & -itis means ""Inflammation"". The Pain is usually SO Bad that they won't Eat or they'll Eat very little to avoid the Pain. What would happen w/ Ingo is that when his Tongue or the Food hit the Sorest Areas of his Gums he'd Puff up, Throw Himself around while Sounding like he was Hacking up Glass, but it was due to a Combo of him Hissing & trying to Remove the Food from around his Sore Gums. Other Cats are known to Drool, Growl, Paw at their Face, etc & tell tale Sign that it's Stomatitis & Not Gingivitis is the Bright Blood Red line that runs down the Gumline directly below the Teeth, but the Guns around the Teeth can also be Blood Red & Noticeably Inflamed/Swollen/Puffy.

I know that I can't Afford Dental Extractions, due to the RidiculouslyOutrageous Costs a Vet Charges, & Full Mouth Extractions is usually what a Vet's Prognosisis is for Stomatitis... ALOT of times they'll do 1/2 the Mouth, but they'll Tell Patients Parents (Dog/Cat Parents), that in Order to Treat it 100% ALL of the Teeth NEED to be Extracted, which can run into the 1000s & sometimes the Age of the Pet makes them not a Candidate for the Anesthesia that's necessary for the Surgical Extractions... & some of us Flat out can't Afford Extractions, ESPECIALLY NOT Full Mouth Extractions. So, what to do?? Let Me tell you: Colloidal Silver is a God Send. Colloidal Silver is what you need & technically should be in EVERy Household. As I mentioned above, I gave Ingo his 1st Die, w/ Gradual Increases starting at approximately 10-11a Monday Morning... It's only Wednesday Night now & already Ingo is Eating, Playing, Trilling & back to his Goofy, Loving, Hilarious Self!! If I Questioned the Power of Colloidal Silver before, I No Longer do! I'm a Believer!!

Colloidal Silver is the Equivalent of an OTC Antibiotic that can be used in People & all Animals (at least Mammals, bc I don't know enough about Reptiles & Birds to say it's Ok for them). It can be used to Treat Inflammation, Sinus Infections, Ear Infections, OBGYN Issues, Eye Infections, Sore Throats, URIs, Cuts, Acne, Bite Wounds (that are more Surface than Deep Tears which Require Stitches), it also Helps Percent Scarring, etc etc etc. I Read Testimonials of People who Suffered from Sinus Infections for Years, that used to Lay them out for Weeks, who now take this as soon as they start Feeling a Speck of a Sinus Infection Symptom & what used to be Weeks in Agony, is now a Few Crappy, but Manageable Days!!

I'd NEVER heard of Colloidal Silver until I was Desperately & Frantically Searching for Things I could do to Relieve &/or Treat Ingo's Symptoms. I was Skeptical of it Working Super Quick, but I Believed other Reviews about how Well this Worked for their Pets Stomatitis & now that I've seen it literally Work Wonders w/ my Own Eyes for Ingo in less than 3 Full Days, I'm a True Believer!

The Best Part about Colloidal Silver, besides that it Works, is that you really can't OD on it & neither can your Pet!! Just make sure you don't take Unnecessarily Excessive Amounts for a REALLY Longtime, as there's Stories of it turning people's Skin Blue Permanently. Don't let that Scare you, it takes ALOT of CS & for a LONGTIME for that to happen!!

If you're as Desperate to Help your Fur Baby, as I was to Help Ingo, you have NOTHING to Lose & EVERYTHING to Gain by Ordering this for yourself &/or your Furry Kid!! Not to mention $20 is ALOT Better than the Beginning of $1000s & a Long & Painful Recovery for your Pet. TRY THIS FIRST! IT WORKS!! I Hope you & Fur Baby Fell Better as Quickly as Ingo did!! üê±"

" December 9, 2023", United States ,4,DejaLiyah,Not sure if it does anything,I got this because I had a 2+ month sinus / throat infection and nothing was working. I got this and didn‚Äôt see any improvement. After trying EVERYTHING I realized that i have ALLERGIES and that is what my flare up was. This did not help but I am finally getting relief from quercetin + vitamin C plus allergy medication + drinking nettle tea. I also ordered other stuff as well. I‚Äôll still hold on to this stuff but it didn‚Äôt help my condition.

" December 2, 2023", United States ,4,Shannon,Product seems fine. Cannot tell is it has helped though.,Hard to say this product is effective althought I know silver is very beneficial in stimulating the immune system. The taste is like water but thicker. Glass bottle so that is good. But who knows. Hard to rate. I would say neutral at this point. Will see if I purchase a second bottle.

" June 20, 2018", United States ,5,Sarah Lowder,Sore or infected throat? This is a remedy that actually works!,"I suffer from sore throats constantly. I get strep, tonsillitis, laryngitis, and throat infections from post nasal drip, bronchitis, colds, allergies, and sinus infections. My immune system can never fight them off and I get lesions all over both tonsils and my throat and the swelling often lands me at urgent care because I become unable to swallow my own spit or breathe. Every sore throat that I have had has landed me on prescription meds and as I've gotten older, my body has become resistant to the antibiotics so my doctors have had to switch strains and increase dosages. If I try to fight it off naturally, they will persist for weeks and are so bad that I am in tears from the pain that feels like swallowing glass. I've tried every remedy known to man (any over the counter sore throat medicine, plus natural remedies like acv, herbs and spices, teas, essential oils, honey, citrus, roots, salt water, Echinacea, etc.) as I have read every blog, forum, and chatroom trying to find something that works so that I don't have to go on antibiotics and steroids. Well, this product is the one and only thing that has ever kept me from going to the doctor for a sore throat. I ordered this last week in 4oz to try as everything is in bloom down here in Tampa, FL and I had a feeling I'd be getting sick soon. Boy am I glad that I did because I woke up Monday and it was like my throat had skipped the initial two days of getting sick as there were already lesions/white pockets covering my right tonsil and the back of my throat. In its entirety, the whole back of my throat was red and swollen and upon waking, it hurt to swallow. I immediately went and grabbed the Sovereign Silver and put three full droppers under my tongue, after thirty seconds, I added three more full droppers and pushed it all to the back of my throat and swished/gargled it around for 60 seconds before swallowing. I popped some vitamins and 800mg of ibuprofen (my doc recommends this for my swelling and pain) and headed to work with the Silver in my hand. I repeated the under the tongue and back of the throat gargles then swallow throughout the day and night, so much that I had actually used half of the bottle by the time I climbed in bed. Tuesday morning, I woke up and my throat was still sore but it didn't hurt to swallow. I ran to the bathroom and holy sh*t y'all, the lesions were gone and my throat was still red but only puffy where the lesions had disappeared from. I had already taken the morning off of work and scheduled a doctors appointment because I truly did not think that this was going to work and I didn't want to suffer before surrendering to my usual concoction of prescriptions. I did the under the tongue/gargle/swallow, cancelled the doctors appointment, and headed to work with the Silver in hand again. I knew I was going to run out by the end of the day so I ordered the 8oz from here and paid $5 for same day delivery (it was delivered by 8:00pm, thanks Amazon!). I continued the same routine and finished off the bottle yesterday (Tuesday) night. Before hitting the hay, my throat was still beet red and swollen, it was sore to swallow but I wasn't in pain. Wednesday morning (today, 7 hours ago) I woke up and my throat is no longer sore or swollen but is still a bit red and I am so totally okay with that!! I cannot believe this actually worked and that it worked as quickly as it did. The only thing that has ever given me this much relief this quickly is when the Doc gives me a shot of prednisone (steroid) and the swelling in the throat goes down within the hour but that still never made the lesions go away like this does. I am in shock. I cannot believe that there isn't more information on the internet regarding this and sore throats. The only draw back for me is the cost, but I will pay any amount to keep from having infected throats. Very thankful for this, I will never let my medicine cabinet go without Sovereign Silver and I am so glad that I no longer have to frequent the doctor and taste all of the disgusting natural remedies that never work."

" June 19, 2015", United States ,5,JustBHappy,Our household will NOT be without this natural MIRACLE in a bottle!!!,"When my son was about 8 he had a SEVERE reaction to an antibiotic after just one dose - swelling of the face and open sores that developed on his lips, the inside of his mouth and all down his throat! He couldn't eat solid food and could barely even swallow liquids for almost 2 weeks without a topical solution to numb the pain.. and the doctor's office would NOT admit this was due to the antibiotic! Internet research confirmed my reluctance to use antibiotics in the first place as well as alerted me to the possibility that it could have been a ""bad batch"" of antibiotics that caused this type of severe reaction. I'd never heard of this before nor had I been warned about the possibility of a reaction such as this. It was a truly horrifying experience that you wouldn't wish anyone to go through, especially a child! My son's lips had so many sores that at night while he slept, since his mouth was shut, they would start to scab over and his lips would actually stick together! We would have to moisten them and pull them apart which would reopen all the wounds again each morning... I would have never imagined antibiotics could cause something this horrific!

I had a choice early on, hospitalize him and put him in the hands of the ""professionals"" I was severely lacking trust in at this point.. or... a friend gave me the name of a naturopath practitioner that actually lived near me who would take an entirely different approach to healing. I went the route of the naturopath and together we helped my son recover from this incident in the comfort & security of our own home.This brilliant & caring woman introduced me to colloidal silver. From that point forward I knew my family of 4 had to take responsibility for our own health instead of blindly leaving it in the hands of others. We became proactive with our health, began eating better and instead of running to the doctor if things cropped up, we used Silver for just about everything and anything... and it worked!

My kids are now 14 & 20 and over the years we've used Silver internally and externally.. in the eyes, ears, sinuses, & throat ..for cuts, rashes, acne, bites and as a general immune booster. Usually if you catch things in the early stages, they never get a chance to turn into anything further. These days we rarely even get a cold and the flu has skipped us for many years now.

A recent health crisis was a pretty severe reaction to a spider bite on my 20 year old son's forearm that turned red and swelled to the radius of a softball which then started spreading up the inside of his arm by way of a 1/2 inch wide raised strip of redness that made it's way up to his bicep by the time he left work. This caused some alarm and he went to immediate care out of fear of the severity of the situation. They confirmed there was infection, however it hadn't entered his bloodstream so though not life threatening, the infection was in fact spreading, possibly to his lymph gland next. Despite his childhood reaction to antibiotics, that's what they prescribed telling him he could take the first dose there and wait to see what happened & at least he was ""in good hands"" should he react again. He didn't take that chance however. He left with the unfilled prescription, went home and started taking doses of Silver every 3-4 hours as well as applying it topically. Within hours the swelling had significantly reduced and the redness began to lessen, both signs the infection was already improving. By the end of the next day, it had completely healed!

Thanks to Sovereign Silver & a healthy diet containing a fair amount of fresh foods, my family is extremely healthy. My 14 year old has never had to take anything other than an occasional pain reliever his entire life and I'm SO grateful we have an alternative to harsh antibiotics and their possible side effects! I continue to be amazed at all it's many uses! Spread the word of this safe & effective alternative!!! People need to know!!!"
" November 16, 2023", United States ,5,KC,Perfect for what I was looking for,"I have used this product for over five years. however, I was buying it from a different vender. I am very happy that I looked for this product on Amazon, due to its price and size. It was much better here then from said other vender. The product itself is as has always been a very good product and one I plan on continuing on using."

" July 11, 2022", United States ,5,Anna,"Give antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungi, and some viruses the big middle finger","I've been using this product for years to treat a wide array of maladies. It kills staph, strep, and more. I've beaten sore throats, styes, stomach bugs, tooth abscesses, and even cystic acne with this product.

Someone close to me has been fighting warts on his hands for two years, and finally - after trying everything on the shelf plus actual cryotherapy to no avail - listened to me and combined an immune-boosting oral dose of this with a topical treatment of silver in gel form to the affected area. The warts disappeared in under a week.

A couple of years ago, I stepped on a wasp barefoot. The stinging, itching, and heat had me resting my foot on an ice pack under my desk at work for several days with no relief. Creams, lotions, and even anti-inflammation pain pills didn't work to treat it. I finally soaked some gauze in this silver, applied to my foot, and wrapped it up before bed. The NEXT MORNING, the venom had been drawn out, and the swelling and heat were reduced to practically nothing, gone completely by the end of the day.

I'm not saying this is a cure-all for literally everything on the planet. I'm not saying it's magical. What I am saying is that it's incredibly versatile, and I always use it as a first defense before resorting to antibiotics. Why? Because of the mechanics by which silver attacks and neutralizes bacteria, there's no way for it to form a resistance. It'd be like you evolving the ability to survive decapitation. It ain't happening.

It's also safe, natural, and non-toxic. Heck, I've cleared my cat of a UTI by adding an adjusted dose to her water. I've healed an infected wound on my dog by applying topically and wrapping, with no worries as to what might happen if the bandage falls off and he licks up the silver.

This particular brand of silver is my trusted go-to because of the high ppm concentration, and the quality glass bottle that keeps the suspension from breaking down over a longer period of time than a plastic one can.

Do yourself a favor: do your research on applicable uses for this product (again, it's *ridiculously* versatile, but there's no such thing as a cure-all), and make it the front-runner of your medicine cabinet."
" February 9, 2023", United States ,5,Joseph E,"Maybe it works, not really sure","Alright folks, let's talk about this ""Silver Bullet"" they call Bio-Active Silver for the immune system. I mean, I get it, who wouldn't want a product that promises to boost your immunity and protect you from all the germs and nasties out there, right? So, I took the plunge and tried it out for a few weeks, hoping for a superhero-like transformation. But here's the truth, I didn't notice any major changes, to be honest. But that doesn't mean this product is a bust.

First off, the packaging is pretty snazzy, with a little bottle that looks like it could cure all your problems with just one spritz. The liquid inside is fairly unassuming, and all-in-all it looks like something you'd find in an old-timey apothecary. It's pretty cool to look at, but whether or not it actually helps your immune system, I can't say for sure.

Now, the taste, oh boy. It's not the greatest. But, I mean, if you're looking for a product that tastes like candy and gives you superpowers, you're probably in the wrong place. It's a bit like drinking liquid metal, and I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. But hey, it's not like I'm drinking it for the taste, I'm drinking it for the benefits, right?

So, did I notice a major improvement in my immunity after taking Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol? No, not really. But, I have to say, the product seems alright. It's not a complete game-changer, but it's not like it did me any harm either. If you're looking for a little extra support for your immune system, it might be worth giving it a try. And hey, who knows, maybe you'll have better luck than I did and turn into a germ-fighting machine."
" November 15, 2023", United States ,5,Gianna,very good benifits,I got this for me and hubby and I started giving it to my kids also

" September 6, 2019", United States ,5,Lin,"Best, Natural antibiotic solution","I developed a Urinary tract infection and I gotten them periodically throughout my life, I‚Äôm 52 years old now. I had my first one in my early 20‚Äôs. I have also had several cases of Pink eye since I was 6 years old, last case of Pink Eye was about 2 years ago. I also suffered from occasional severe sinus infections throughout my life too. Colloidal Silver once I read about it and started using it, has worked better than any antibiotic a Doctor prescribed for me, with no side effects. Colloidal Silver can take a little longer to cure an infection depending on how long you waited to treat it and how severe of an infection you have but I personally prefer natural with no side effects than manufactured, with negative side effects. I take the prescribed on the bottle amount internally and then drop 2 to 3 drops in each eye throughout the day to cure Pink Eye. Sinus infection, take prescribed amount internally and then clean my hands and put a dropper full into one hand, close one nostril and then snort the Colloidal Silver this way, up each nostril, several times a day until the sinus infection is gone. I do the same when I get an I.U.D. & then I place a cotton ball with Colloidal Silver all over it and place that over my Urethal opening, overnight & I start to feel better the next day and I keep doing this until the burning sensation stops on my Urethal opening and the urgency to pee subsides back down to normal and there is no more pain when I urinate or in my bladder. I am not a Doctor,I can only tell you my personal stories of success through trial and error of what worked for me in regards to using Colloidal Silver. Everybody‚Äôs genetics, chemical makeup, physical bodies are different and what works for me may be different than what works for you. Use the methods that work best for you, including going to a Doctor and purchasing a pharmaceutical drug, antibiotic that works for you.Sovereign Silver does appear to work faster and better than other forms of Colloidal Silver in my opinion and through all of the different types I have tried over the years. I love the way this was packaged and sent to me. One bigger sized cardboard box with a little bit of a smaller cardboard box within it & then a black, medium density, slightly, malleable plastic/rubber mix, cap on each end of the thinner, cardboard box that contained the Colloidal Silver bottle, along with a couple of clear, plastic, air filled bubbles on each side of box that held the bottle. I have Prime Amazon and my package arrive on the date they told me it would, which was the next day and product arrive completely intact and unbroken. I love this product and the people that packaged and delivered it to me undamaged."

" April 28, 2023", United States ,5,Loende,Near miraculous results!,"In all my years of rescue, I've never seen anything like it.... I can admit it, I used this as a Hail Mary on a 9 week old kitten's infected eye and now I'm so glad that I did! The eye hadn't been responding to Terramycin and was so swollen and bulging that I was scared to even give her her oral antibiotics for fear that the stress of it would increase the pressure in the eye too much and it would rupture. I started the night this was delivered with two drops, repeating every 4h. In 24h the swelling was significantly diminished. I lowered the dosage to 2 drops every 6h for the next 72 hrs, when the eye opened, then 2 drops every 8h for the following 3 days. Terramycin was still administered 3x/d. On day 7, there was a clear, healthy eye, with no sign of any trauma or disease. I continued dosing 1 drop every 12h for another week to be sure. She went from an oozing, super infected, completely compromised eye that was ready to rupture at any moment to a PERFECTLY HEALED EYE that showed no sign that there had EVER been anything wrong with it. In SEVEN DAYS. If that's not a miracle, I don't know what is..."
" May 30, 2023", United States ,5,Tell it Like it is!,Kills Parvovirus in dogs in 24 hours!!!!,"This product is a must have in your medicine cabinet. I‚Äôve cured two dogs in the last 5 years that caught Parvovirus.

My 3 year old American Bully started having uncontrollable bloody diarrhea and constant vomiting. He soon was very unstable and was borderline paralyzed from lack of energy. My local veterinary hospital wanted $200 emergency visit fee plus any medications or procedures that were not even guaranteed to work. I‚Äôm on a broken fixed income and live month to month. I didn‚Äôt have $200 plus any added fees for a veterinarian. I knew Sovereign Silver worked before and so I drove an hour away to find a bottle. Administered a teaspoon via dropper every hour for the next 8 hours to my pup. This Silver was the first liquid he was able to hold down. All night long I kept giving him this silver. The next morning he was able to walk. He still had diarrhea, but it wasn‚Äôt bloody. Later that same day his diarrhea stopped. He began eating solid foods again. His eyes were bright again. Even his coat was shining again. This is truly a miracle liquid. I Highly Recommend this product. I‚Äôm not a doctor or veterinarian and cannot give medical advice. I‚Äôm only relaying what I know worked for me."
" November 5, 2023", United States ,5,RDHS,Helps boost your immune system‚Äôs,I take this all winter long
" December 21, 2022", United States ,5,JdS,Used for over 22 years,"Used for over 22 years, this was recommended to me by a holistic vet. Since then I have been using it for my animals and for myself I‚Äôve recommended it for my family members and everyone swears by it. So to the reviewer that said never swallow it he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. He sites the FDA which the FDA is in bed with big Pharma and that‚Äôs the only reason they are dismissing colloidal silver. I take orally when I feel like I‚Äôm getting sick I gargle with it when I‚Äôm getting a sore throat I use it for any type of skin infection I have used it in my cats eyes with success better than any prescription the doctor or I should say a vet would prescribe. My granddaughter cleared up Pink EYE with colloidal silver and her doctor praised her mother for using a natural product. My son used it for cellulitis when the antibiotic couldn‚Äôt finish the Collodial silver did, he used it orally and topically. This brand may be expensive this is the one I have used for over 22 years and I believe it is the best. What I recommend to people start out slow you use common sense you‚Äôre not gonna drink the stuff. For example if I‚Äôm sick I might take a tablespoon four or five times a day. And I‚Äôm sure you can take more but it seems to work for me I use it like a regular antibiotic you take at intervals. So if what you‚Äôre reading online or reviews like the one that cited the FDA, ignore it and try it I wouldn‚Äôt be without it ever."

It has prevented them from getting the serious infection that they normally would have gotten from their wounds. One of my Jack Russells had a horrible large puncture wound on the back of his neck. ( I have NO IDEA how he got hurt this way) He hated for anyone to touch him when he was hurt. The only thing I did for this large puncture wound was to give him 1cc or 1ml of Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Hydrosol , using a NEEDLELESS allergy size syringe or insulin size syringe orally 4 to six times a day. He readily accepted it. It tastes like pure water. This wound completely healed from the inside out. I have saved a fortune in vet bills treating my own pets this way.
It works equally well on humans! I use the nasal sprayer on myself to treat and prevent sinusitis and sinus infections. I have not had another infection since I began doing this for myself. I use it for burns, insect bites, sore throat, cuts, toenails and fingernails when they need it. I used it when I had SHINGLES on my face!! I never got the normally seen secondary infection. Everytime my face burned or itched I took a teaspoon ( 5ml or 5cc ) of the Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol. It worked!!! Their recommended dosing is accurate!! It is hard to believe, at first, that only a teaspoon at a time is really going to help.
For me... just a spray or two at a time in my mouth or nose has also really helped. Now I do only that much a day to ward off whatever I may have come into contact with.
It gives me peace of mind with all you can get from a tick bite that you never see, mosquito bites, super-bugs & flesh eating Strep-A that is everywhere!
But that is just me.
Try it for yourself, your family and your pets.
Still, go to your doctor when you need to.
I keep a 32 oz bottle at all times. It costs much less to use it that way. It is a very inexpensive & highly effective product to use.

" March 20, 2023", United States ,3,Celeste T,Honestly can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs working ‚ÄºÔ∏èUPDATED,"First let me say that this is not the first time I have used this product. Every time I do get it, the dropper does not fill up, as shown in my pic. It never works. This is literally like water. I feel like the first time I used this it might‚Äôve helped me get over a toothache and cold. I could be wrong though and it could just be coincidence. But, I suffer from random rash breakouts and joint pains (currently getting tested for autoimmune diseases) and every time I have put this on an itchy spot, it stops the itch. I thought it was all in my head and that I just convinced myself it was working but it really did help. Multiple times. So for that, and for really feeling that it helped with the toothache, I give it 4 stars. I‚Äôm going to continue using and see if anything changes.

‚ÄºÔ∏èUPDATE ‚ÄºÔ∏è

I stand by what I say about it helping with itchiness HOWEVER, it for sure does not help with colds or sickness, in my case. Had a consistent harsh cough, lost my sense of taste and smell, and had food poisoning in a separate occasion. It did nothing for neither issue and I remained the same, even after drinking the max amount per day. It didn‚Äôt help at all. For this, 3 stars, because what is it really good for then?"

" August 22, 2018", United States ,5,Jessica H.,AMAZING PRODUCT! TREATED PUPPY STRANGLES!,"My 4 week old mini dachshund mix puppy was disgnosed with puppy strangles (juvenile cellulitis) just 4 days after we adopted her. This disorder is aggressive & began to take over her little body with oozing abscess sores & swelling of her lymph nodes. She started on antibiotics & steroids but those weren‚Äôt seeming to help very much; even after her being on them for 3 weeks. Everyday I would come home to multiple abscesses & sores ranging from pea size to quarter size that would open & drain puss/blood. I couldn‚Äôt keep track of how many holes she had on her little head, face, ears, neck & body, & also had puss-like fluid sitting in her ear canals. Her poor head was literally filled with puss & was oozing everywhere. I was desperate for something I could try that wouldn‚Äôt interfere with her prescribed meds. Within 7 days of adding this supplement to her cocktail of medicine (cephalexin every 8 hours & steroids every 24 hours) & also spraying it on her sores, I saw a huge turn around. I have now began the taper process off the steroids & her antibiotics expired. We are just 2 days shy of using this for 2 weeks & she is almost 100% healed. I recommend this supplement 1000%. Anyone & everyone with pets that ever get cuts or any type of skin issue should know about this product. It needs to be on the shelves of every single vet office!"
" February 23, 2023", United States ,4,tiffany,I purchased this for BV,A friend of mine used this to assist with clearing BV and it worked for her. I was a little afraid it might burn my coco so I didn't add the same measurements that she did but it seems to have helped with only 3 days of use. I would have to go back to the doctor to be absolutely sure that it's not present. I would not advise anyone to order this for this purpose as I was instructed by some I know on correct measurements and exactly how to insert it. IM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. I will hold on to the rest of it for any future problem that may occur that might warrant me to have to use this for its general purpose.
" November 6, 2021", United States ,5,TamReview,Life saver for wound care,"This has saved & extended my mom's life, I'm sure, by preventing infection in wounds for years. Wounds that don't heal quickly like ulcers need to be continually protected from bacteria. Antibiotics can't be taken long term due to bacteria developing resistance and health problems coming from continual decimation of the positive internal bacteria (probiotics) that bodies need. Enter silver! It's an element that kills bacteria on contact (iodine is another one), so spraying it on a surface will kill bacteria where it's sprayed. (By the way, I've been told we shouldn't use silver and iodine together -- they can form compounds that can cancel out each other's benefit or something.) This product offers just silver (the element, Ag) suspended as tiny particles in water (which is definition of ""colloidal""). The tiny size of particles means it can reach into and touch more surfaces and interact better (I'm unclear of mechanisms here) and hence have better killing power than larger particles. In large enough quantities, silver is toxic to humans, but in small volumes (e.g. a few sprays daily for years), I don't think it causes any harm to human cells. It also can be applied to the surface of skin, so it doesn't have to go to the gut to affect our GI tract bacteria. Highly recommend using this. It's odorless and painfree, and doesn't stain, feels like spraying on water. Silver been used in wars and other areas of the world where drugs are in short supply for a very long time to prevent and clear up infections."
" June 28, 2023", United States ,4,Sibel,Effective product,I live in central cali and air quality is bad here my cat gets lots of allergies and her eyes always watering and sneezing. Since I used this product on her eyes she is doing an amazing.
" May 28, 2018", United States ,5,Animal lover,Good for whatever ails you,"On my doctor's recommendation, I started using Severin Silver about 15 years ago for a variety of reasons.
- Initially I took it to shorten the duration of weekly herpes outbreaks (Ewww.). I take it orally and put the gel right on the herpes sore. If I'm consistent in taking it every day, however (about 1 teaspoon twice a day,) I don't even get an outbreak. But alas, I'm human and do forget. I double the dosage (about a tbsp every 2-3 hours during an outbreak) and it shortens the healing from a week to 2-3 days.
- Ditto for colds, infections, skin sores and plugged nasal passages.
- The biggest help, however, is using SS for Epstein Barr Virus. If I use it every day I keep the virus in abeyance (1-2 tsps /day.) If I forget to take it, symptoms come on after a couple of days of abstainence, but go away quickly when I start the dosage again.
- The biggest surprise was using it on impulse to get rid of a huge wart on my leg. Ewww again. I tried several other remedies to shrink it, to no avail. Then I put some of the SS gel on a cotton facial cleanser pad and taped it over the wart. I changed the ""bandage"" after every shower (daily.) I saw a difference after the second day. While it took about three weeks, I saw an improvement every time I changed the bandage. The wart, or whatever it was completely gone in 3-4 weeks and has sprouted back up for over 6 months.
- And lastly, I tried it on a few skin tags and it work on them as well. Just amazing.
I really love this stuff and particularly the Sovereign brand. Like someone else's review, I'd give it 10 stars too."

" February 23, 2018", United States ,5,Marly,I can't live without this!!,"After buying dozens of products for a myriad of health issues, I finally realized this is the ONLY product I need. Having been forced to take a steroid prescription, I was left with all sorts of fungal problems....itchy skin, perioral dermatitis, then something that
made me look like my face had chicken pox -- these painful little cyst-like bumps with goo inside each spot. I know what doctors
do...they prescribe cortisone for skin problems and I know this was fungal, caused by the original steroid prescription, so I then bought one topical anti fungal soap, cream, lotion, shampoo....after another, to no avail. I then thought I was getting a UTI so I
took this silver fora few days and voila, it was gone.......Of course, I got a lowered immunity from having been prescribed steroids...Now I took the silver orally because I was having to kill yeast/fungus/candida and boost my immune system. For so long, I was at my wits end. My savior was this one product....Soverign Silver....I first started taking a few drops per day and went up to dropperfuls...washing my face, then putting the silver on my face with a cotton ball, letting it dry...Adding some silver to my shampoo, to my conditioner, to my skin creams....Everything I did every day was including this silver product...Internally, topically....and then I started seeing results... very slowly....a few weeks...but I started making great progress....This is a product with miraculous results....Everyone needs at least one bottle in their house....for bug bites, cuts, burns, even things that appear on the skin or present as viruses....a sore throat, a stuffy nose....itchy eyes. I've used this silver for so many different issues. I've squirted the silver into my eyes when they were burning....(likely due to this chronic fungal
condition) and it felt soothing. There are probably thousands of conditions where this silver is better than everything else....
better than prescriptions, natural products and products designed for maybe just fungus....those anti fungal shampoos which leave
hair dry, or oily and in many cases don't work. If something is going on outside of the body, it likely needs help inside the body....
kill the ""bugs""....(and then think of replacing good bacteria with some probiotics). Honestly, I've been itching and looking at my
terrible skin for months...It's slowly starting to heal...I credit this silver product to my healing....taking it orally and putting it on my
skin. It's my miracle in a bottle!"

" April 17, 2015", United States ,5,H. Song,Amazing!!,"My 7-year-old dog developed some sort of growth on the temporal corner of his right eye in October 2014. It didn't look like a tumor and it wasn't bothering him, so I decided to just watch it. The growth was about 1/4"" long when about half of it fell off in late November. I still kept an eye on it, hoping it would just fall off on its own without veterinary intervention. However, it grew to about 1/2"" long by March 2015, and for some reason, the base of it started bleeding one night. Next morning, I immediately made a vet appointment for 3 days later. Meanwhile, I thought I'd just TRY doing something, just to stop the bleeding. I already had a 2 oz. bottle of Sovereign Silver in the house, so I sprayed some on a cotton ball and dabbed the area. A day later, I noticed nearly a half of the growth was gone. I initially thought it might have fallen off because of the bleeding or something, so I just continued dabbing with Sovereign Silver. Next day, MOST of it was gone. There was a tiny, tiny little bit of the ""base"" left, and that's all we had left to show the vet (I had to show him pictures to prove that something WAS there). The vet didn't know what the cause was, and wanted to do surgery to completely remove it and do some testing, but I decided to think about it since colloidal silver seemed to be doing something. So I continued to dab the area of the growth 2-3 times a day, and guess what? It looks as if nothing ever happened. I also used it on my dog's hot spots in the past. Sovereign Silver is definitely a keeper! I'll continue to buy it as long as they keep making it.

Now, before some of you go on judging me about how we never figured out why exactly my dog got the growth in the first place, I had about $330 worth of blood work and testing done, and everything was great. Also, the growth was definitely NOT a tumor, so I'm not claiming that colloidal silver removed my dog's eye tumor."
" April 21, 2021", United States ,5,Damon Raphael,Colloidal river may be of value in chronic nasal infection,"I am NOT using colloidal silver as a tonic. I believe that is pseudo-science.
But I am interested in its use for chronic sinus infections. I used colloidal silver for sinus infection in childhood, during the 1940s, before the antibiotic era.
Many people suffer from persistent or recurrent sinus infections that become resistant to antibiotics. The are research papers, which indicate that colloidal silver may be of some value in treating these conditions. The antibiotic resistance is attributed to the formation od a ""biofilm"" by the bacteria. The term describes the ability of some bacteria to form a protected environment, which prevents an effective level of antibiotic from inhibiting their growth or killing them. Dental plaque is an example of a biofilm.
In vitro studies (in culture medium-not in the body) have demonstrated that that colloidal silver does not penetrate the cell wall, but affects the external environment of the bacteria, stopping their growth. A colloidal silver atom has a positive charge, which causes it to be attracted to the cell wall of bacteria, according to research studies.
While colloidal silver is easily sprayed into the nose, or introduced into the nasal passages with cotton tipped applicators, it is uncertain whether such methods can deliver an effective concentration of colloidal silver to the interior of the sinus cavities, where the infection is.
I am seeing some positive results in my own condition, but whether or not, it will result in a cure, remains to be seen."

My 11-year-old female Khaki Campbell (duck) was suffering from reproductive ailments for years, and the vet did not know how to help her. I read about colloidal silver and decided to give it a try. Within weeks, ""Libby"" began acting like her old self again, and when the vet examined her, he could not find any lumps, growths, or eggs in her abdomen. The vet was amazed and told me to continue treating Libby with the colloidal silver. I just bought a giant-sized bottle of this stuff, and I am going to keep Libby on it indefinitely. Highly recommended!"
" March 23, 2022", United States ,5,Stacy S.,Works SO WELL,"Everytime we start to feel under the weather we take this stuff and our sickness is gone!

My baby even had congestion he couldn't get over for weeks. I thought maybe it was me consuming to much dairy again and I needed to cut back (as that occurred when he was a newborn and removing dairy from my diet fixed his congestion issues he had as a result of nursing) but it didn't seem to make a difference. I decided it must be a small virus he couldn't kick so I tried a small amount of silver and the next day his congestion was gone. I didn't want to give him to much so I waited but that night it started coming back so I gave him two more doses over the next 24 hours and again the congestion disappeared. After WEEKS of having to use the nose Frida multiple times a day and his poor little cough getting worse and worse I couldn't believe he got better so quickly.

I got this in case we got sick with the Big C to help our symtoms but I'm glad I've had it on hand for other things. We've been lucky enough to stay well the past few months and I attribute that to having silver as needed."

" July 20, 2019", United States ,5,Cristie L.,Sovereign Silver Is FANTASTIC!,"Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol is AH-MAZING!!! I absolutely ‚ô•Ô∏è LOVE ‚ô•Ô∏è it, have purchased it several times (in increasingly larger bottles, LOL üòâ) and use it for a plethora of things. After doing significant research re: colloidal silver, I purchased this specific brand ""Sovereign Silver"" here on Amazon. (I'm a middle school teacher, I research EVERYTHING. It's just who I am...I can't make a purchase without doing research. Drives some of my friends and family *crazy*...oh well!)

The bottle states, ""Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol - Immune Support""...but it can be used MYRIAD different ways, including topically to put on cuts/scrapes...I have/do use it on my multiple ear/facial piercings if they start to feel achy or sore. In a day or two, all better! I also put drops of it into my dogs' water bowl [it is clear, odorless and tasteless] because it helps with their teeth cleanliness *and* it REALLY freshens their breath...MUCH better than any of the ""dog breath fresheners"" on the market. (How do I know this, you ask? The answer is that I've tried all of them (or *at least* 35-40 of them, LOL!)

I adore my dogs (both rescues) but as they've aged, their oral hygiene has become more difficult to manage. My chihuahua is now 18 years old, has become almost completely deaf, and has the stinkiest breath you can imagine! üê∂üòÜ However, I love him BIG ‚ô•Ô∏è and would try ANYTHING to make him happy, comfortable and healthy. Adding a few drops of Sovereign Silver to his water every day is such an easy way to keep his teeth/gums healthy AND to freshen his breath...I don't have to struggle to get a canine toothbrush/toothpaste into his tiny mouth (something he HATES) *and* something that really never fully addressed the ""bad breath"" issue.

If you are looking for colloidal silver, I highly recommend purchasing this particular brand, ""Sovereign Silver."" You won't be disappointed!"
" August 6, 2021", United States ,5,biz888,MY SEVERE ALLERGIES are GONE in TWO DAYS!!!,"Five days ago, I bought Colloidal Silver to splash on my face as I did micro needling & a bit of fibroblast as recommended by the wonderful TJ Tutorials on youtube. I didn't realize the one I bought was 10ppm and that there are different strengths. I read the positive reviews on how it cures allergies. Well, I have 365 days allergy; my sinus won't stop from running, eyes itching if I don't take Allegra. I take double 24 hours Allegra every morning and Benadryl before I go to sleep. That doesn't include the TWO years of allergy injection once a week! I take AC vinegar to neutralize all these meds and get them out of my body every day. I started taking it 5 days ago, and I noticed the following day, my nose was all dry! No runny nose! I stopped taking the Allegra, and yesterday I stopped the Benadryl as well. I can't believe it! OMG, I am healed. NO runny nose, no itchy eyes even around the cats! So, I increased the dosage to this 500ppm. If the 10ppm healed me in two days, what more with this?"

" December 1, 2014", United States ,5,Neem,Miraculous Results,"I cannot say enough about this product. My daughter brought it to my attention when I developed a skin rash that ran over 1/2 of my body within 24 hours. It was so itchy. Even Rx steriod creams didn't help. I was miserable. She brought me a bottle of this product and I applied it all over. Within minutes the itch was relieved and within 24 hours (more applications every few hours) there was significant healing . It has been about 10 days (and I ordered this bottle as I was getting low on the bottle she brought me) and I am continuing to heal. Rash is just about gone. I should say that I combined this with Vetiver essential oil which is supposed to have healing properties for rashes as well. Between the 2 products I have had very good response.

I have also been taking it internally as recommended on the label.

I also have a dog who has an eye infection. I was giving her Terramycin eye ointment for her infection and it wasn't getting better. So I tried this and overnight I saw significant improvement. At this rate I'm thinking she will be free of infection within a couple of days.

I will not be without this product in my first aid cabinet, ever.

My granddaughter had an outbreak of pimples (no doubt monthly hormones were the cause) and we put this on her outbreak. She uses Pro-active which is very helpful, but this product worked to heal within 2 days.

While waiting for this order I shopped at the local vitamin store and while looking at collodial silver products I asked the ownr if the 30 PPM product would be better than this one which is 10PPM. He said no because this product has the smallest molecular structure which make it more readily deposited in the body (not his exact words, but something to that effect). So stick with this product."
" February 7, 2021", United States ,5,serena Lamla,GREAT UNIVERSAL HEALING POTION,"Everyone should have Colloidal Silver in the house! This natural healer has a long list of beneficial therapeutic properties from boosting your immune system to treating skin infections. Google it! ;)
I recently had been unsuccessfully trying to heal a nasty allergic reaction that turned infected and then into a lingering skin inflammation. To this day, I don't know how I could have forgotten about the two powerhouse healers, Colloidal Silver, as well as Aloe Vera. As soon as I applied a high quality liquified form of Aloe Vera (being able to deeply penetrate skin layers), as well as the amazing ""SOVEREIGN SILVER FIRST AID TOPICAL HEALING GEL"", my poor and by then confused and over irritated skin said ""ahhh, finally"" and turned the corner into the direction of improvement and regeneration. Our body speaks to us, all we have to do is learn how to listen.
I am currently using, and shall continue to do so on a daily basis, the Sovereign Silver Colloidal Silver, internally for immune system maintenance as well as sprayed on my skin whenever there is any irritation, and their *****First Aid Gel***** is from now on a staple in my medicine cabinet.

" April 28, 2020", United States ,5,Wendy Lou,THIS WORKS!!!,"I have a boxer pup that has Puppy Pyoderma (Staphylococcus bacteria) all over her body. She had it when I got her and it just got worse and worse. I spent quite a bit of money at the vets, for antibiotics and shampoos. These only held the problem at bay. My poor pup would itch and scratch herself all the time. She had small pus filled bumps all over her body and legs, she was missing hair and had red raw skin. I did not want to continue to have her on antibiotics and give her more problems. I found this Silver product searching for a more natural cure for her bacteria infection, and read the reviews. I decided why not try it. I am so pleased with the results so far. With in 3 days I started seeing less bumps on her body everywhere, and it just keeps getting better. She has had this infection for about 6 months, it was what they call a deep infection, so it had a strong hold on her body. She has been on the Silver for 1 week now, and almost all her bumps are gone. She has some still on her legs, but they are slowly going away. She looks like a normal healthy young dog now, not like she got into a hornets nest. I will be using this Silver for my dogs and for myself and family. It can help with many things from what I have read about it. If you have doubts buy a small bottle. You might be glad you tried it, I am so glad I did. IT WORKS!"

They‚Äôre also in most foods‚Ä¶ which is super fun because my main symptoms after I‚Äôve accidentally ingested the tiniest molecule‚Ä¶ is cystic acne. I have learned enough to stay away, but I can‚Äôt clean my oil skin with anything except water, which leads to more acne. It‚Äôs been a super fun cycle.

Enter this. Someone in my coconut allergy group on FB said she cleaned her skin with it and it cleared up her face. I already had this bottle on hand and had forgotten about it, so I gave it a shot. My face finally cleared up after 2 days of use, but I noticed a difference the next morning after only one use. Someone it controls my oil production, so I wipe my face with water on a cloth, then fab this all over. My scars are fading faster too.

New holy grail for acne care and I won‚Äôt be without it."

" December 2, 2023", United States ,4,Shannon,Product seems fine. Cannot tell is it has helped though.,Hard to say this product is effective althought I know silver is very beneficial in stimulating the immune system. The taste is like water but thicker. Glass bottle so that is good. But who knows. Hard to rate. I would say neutral at this point. Will see if I purchase a second bottle.

" November 24, 2023", United States ,4,EMTBilliam,Works Great!,My wife uses this daily! No complaints!
" November 22, 2023", United States ,1,Kindle Customer,Does not have absorption,"After researching this product against colloidal silver(which should ALWAYS be an amber color), the only information I found was the Sovereign Silver(supplier) website or other websites linked to them. I didn't realize this at the time so I ordered this product. After receiving this I noticed this is a completely different product than colloidal silver and a clear color. I dug up a medical research on colloidal and silver hydrosol and the colorless counterparts had no absorption in the body. Colloidal Silver which is the amber color always, has been used since the 1800's and researched well. Hydrosol, even if it's 'bio active' has no benefits on the body because the body cannot absorb it. I recommend MesoSilver, Silver Wings and Coated Silver brands after looking into this. As far as the PPM for you, you'll have to do your own research!"
" November 20, 2023", United States ,2,JP,Poor,I disliked the fact that the dropper would not fill. Maybe filled up 1/4 th the way. I couldn‚Äôt tell it was doing anything toward fighting infection

" October 21, 2023", United States ,1,Hardskullz,This is a snake oil scam!!!,"This is poison!! and a snake oil scam! There is NO scientific or clinical evidence whatsoever that ingesting colloidal silver solution orally can benefit your health. Silver has no known functions or benefits to the human body when taken by mouth, and it is not an essential mineral. In fact taking silver solution in the long run can have serious side effects, it can permanently turn your skin into a bluish tint and can also damage your kidneys and liver, and can alter brain function. Do your research and be informed!!!"

Taken with antibiotics actually helps synergize the effects. But you can't trust hippie holistic-care cause they haven't figured out an effective regimen for 500 ppm vs 10,000 pm for specific illnesses. Lesson learned!"
