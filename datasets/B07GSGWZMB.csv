" August 4, 2023", United States ,5,Lori C,So far so good!!,"I just started taking these and have felt a difference in joint pain and my back pain. No fishy taste or burps, but if you stick your nose in the bottle it does smell fishy but it is supposed to. Not a huge deal for me as long as it helps. They are easy to swallow and I have started off just taking one capsule daily to see if that is enough. If not after a week or so I will bump it up to 2 daily. I do recommend these and they are a good price for krill."
" December 18, 2023", United States ,5,James Oliver,Excellent product,good quality was as advertised.
" September 21, 2023", United States ,4,Tjones,Broken Capsule,"I‚Äôve been taking these for a couple of years and not sure if they have helped or not. I stopped a few times and didn't notice a difference. My latest bottle had a broken capsule and all the other capsules are oily and smell awful not to mention the taste. Trying to get through the bottle, but I gag a little every time. I know others see a difference, so I may keep taking and hope that the next bottle is fully in tact."
" October 24, 2023", United States ,5,DesertPanda,"If you get heartburn from fish oil, TRY THESE","I've tried many fish oil and krill oil pills, trying to find something that doesn't give me heartburn but still provides omega 3. This is the best I've found. No fishy smell, no weird aftertastes or burps.

The only issue I found, and others have echoed, is that all my pills were fused together fr the desert heat. After they cooled down, I simply smacked the bottle around and most of them broke apart. A couple stayed stuck together (and some broke when I tried to force them apart), but all I'm all I'm very pleased with this brand!"
" January 5, 2024", United States ,5,WC Caughman @ Lake Lanier,Krill oil is the best to buy!!,"Haven‚Äôt used it yet, but I know my regular Nature Made fish oil is good, but I‚Äôve always heard that Krill oil is much better!"
" December 24, 2023", United States ,5,Brian,Good Price,Bought for my health.
" January 7, 2024", United States ,3,Lenape,Burping up nasty fish taste,"I bought these Krill supplements because they are supposed to be good at lowering cholesterol. I‚Äôve just starting taking them so I can‚Äôt speak to that yet. However a big reason I chose this brand is because people said there was no fish taste or burping up a fish taste. That‚Äôs not true. Everytime I take one I am burping up a terrible fish taste. It‚Äôs really awful. I hope they work for the purpose I bought them, but this fish taste is a bummer. 3 stars because of the fish taste."

" January 2, 2024", United States ,3,Dale,"Quality omega-3 gels, but only if the packaging is good.","Price was very reasonable. The first bottle of 240 softgels I ordered in the summer of 2023 was very good, and I had no problems using the capsules daily. With the second order of 120 soft gels I ordered in December I was not so lucky. A couple of capsules had apparently leaked and all the gelsl capsules are stuck together. Tried separating them but they just burst. So I'm out the cost of a bottle of these Krill Oil gels and unfortunately I might have to reconsider what I order in the future."
" September 27, 2023", United States ,4,Peter Rabbit,All pills stuck in the bottle,"All of the pills in the bottle were stuck together. I have purchased this particular item many times. This is the first time I have experienced pills being stuck together. I really like this item. I use it for cardiovascular health. The quality seems to be good, but I am not happy with the condition of these pills. My products that I buy from Amazon never set on my porch very long."

Just a warning for you: do not order this when the weather is hot, the softgels all stuck together and I could not even separate them, I had to request a refund."

" November 5, 2023", United States ,3,jdsergent,Smell/size of capsule,"Purchased for my daughter. However, capsules smell bad and are too large for her to swallow. Tried to process a return and it says nonrefundable. However on the main listing page it says ‚Äúeligible for return‚Äù. What I didn‚Äôt know was that when you click on Eligible for return under the listing, it THEN says nonreturnable. Very deceptive and can‚Äôt get my money back. Listing needs to be clearer about eligibility for return"
" November 10, 2023", United States ,5,BEN J ROSCOE,Great product,For the price you can't beat these.
" April 16, 2023", United States ,5,Gcx,Does the trick for me!,"I was having a lot of leg swelling because of sitting for hours... I need both of my hips replaced and am waiting for a surgery date... Ho hum??? I had read other customers who purchased this product say that their leg swelling was in decline from taking this Krill Oil... It took about two weeks but my swelling started going down and now I can see the veins and bones in my feet again, even my calves are showing vain and no real swelling. After 2 months I have now purchased another bottle... Overall, I feel That Krill oil is superiors to fish oil for this purpose and recommend others with swelling try it!

I'm a believer now and will stay on the regimen I now use... 2 soft gels every 2 days seems to work, as well there is other health benefits for the use of this oil and I'm keeping an eye on my blood labs to see if they change over time in the good and bad cholesterol Zone...So far it seems to be helping in that area too!

Gcx..."
" October 18, 2023", United States ,5,Gary T.,Quality product,"Packaging is good. No issues with the product. No bad taste or smell. Softgel size is typical with other fish oil products. Not small, but not so large you can't easily swallow it."

" December 8, 2023", United States ,3,Chick,Smells,It smells like fish I'll finish the bottle but probably won't order again
" July 7, 2023", United States ,4,pluff2,Large Supplement,"The effects of the Krill Oil may be the same as the supplement I took before, however these supplement oils are twice the size as the previous manufacturer that were not available. I most likely will not purchase these again because of size."
" September 28, 2023", United States ,5,vicocar,Noticeable in the body,This is supposed to be a good product. It's supposed to help and protect the eyes among other qualities. This was my purpose for the purchase and found it to be superior to other brands used. Haven't tried all other brands but definitely a good selection for me.
" January 14, 2024", United States ,2,Maxwell Syndstrom,All stuck together and went horribly rancid fast,"Same as many others here, first bottle no problem, but the second one showed up as one lump all glued together. I‚Äôve plucked the pills apart as I‚Äôve used them, but then they got so rancid my bedroom fills with the odor of long dead and rotting fish each time I open the bottle. Stopped taking them obviously and now they sit on my shelf as a monument to years past when I used to visit the shores of Lake Michigan after a mass fish die off in spring. Imagine a dead whale carcass poised for months on the beach during a climate change Arctic summer. You get the idea. I think I will not order these any more. Statins will do. I‚Äôm old. I ache. It is nature‚Äôs way and I‚Äôm going with the flow from here on out."
" July 14, 2023", United States ,4,ReaderInChicago,Rarely fishy,These are large pills that are somewhat easy to swallow. The thing I like best about though is the lack of fish aftertaste that I have had with other fish oil supplements.
" October 15, 2023", United States ,5,Julie,Effective,"Use this as part of my heart health regimen. I take in the mornings because sometimes it gives me indigestion. Overall, it works great. No bad after taste and easy to swallow."
" September 11, 2022", United States ,5,T. Burns,Nature‚Äôs Supplement,"I wanted to write this review for a couple of reasons. First of all, A few years ago I was told by my specialist to take Fish Oil for a condition. I did some research and found Krill Oil was at least comparable to fish oil, as it high in Omega 3 fatty acid. I figured if blue whales could take it, so could I. I have been taking Krill Oil for about 5 years, and this particular product for about 3 years. It is the best price. I have no side effects. Occasionally I will be able to have a fishy taste in my mouth. Everyone‚Äôs body reacts differently to anything you ingest. You need to realize you are taking fish oil - it will not taste like chocolate! It is a larger pill, but it is 1000mg, so you can get the most benefits from that dosage. I never get headaches, and I also notice that I do not get body aches or swelling. I‚Äôm a runner and run 3-4 times per week. I attribute this supplement with helping maintain my body, and slowing the progression of my condition. I have not regretted using this and my body has become accustomed to its addition. No supplement will ever cure you of anything, but with proper life choices and this as an addition, it can add to a healthy life."
" September 9, 2023", United States ,5,N. Gilliland,Quality product.,"I read about Krill oil online. I found these on Amazon and had to buy them.
They are not overly expensive. But honestly I'm not sure I can tell I'm taking
them. It might take 30 days before any difference shows up. It might be the
fact I'm 72. I might just have waited too long.

" October 19, 2023", United States ,5,Jim Elliott,I take it daily.,Since taking the arctic Krill daily; I use less nitroglycerine!
" September 29, 2023", United States ,5,Blaine Coleman,"These capsules don't have a strong ""fish"" smell","I take one of these a day to meet the recommended amount and they price is far less than at local, even big box, stores. And delivery is always fast."
" October 21, 2023", United States ,5,DebC,Is what it is,No complaints... Did exactly what it was supposed to do
" November 1, 2023", United States ,5,Gary S.,Always top choice,Great value
" September 25, 2023", United States ,3,Traci,Broken capsules,My krill oil arrived on time but when I opened them a handful of my capsules were broken and the liquid spilled out over the other pills. This has made many of them stick together and they break when forcing them apart. And if you are familiar will krill oil it smells fishy so my bottle really smells when I open it.
" January 20, 2023", United States ,5,Alexandria Lee,This Worked for Me!,"I began taking these 3 months ago. My overall cholesterol at the time was 203. At the time I was already on a low dose statin with another brand of fish oil along with a low fat diet. My doctor told me that he was concerned. I told him to give me 3 months to come back for a follow up with blood work. He agreed. The only thing that I changed was the fish oil which guided me to this product. Three months passed and I went back for my lab work. A week later my doctor saw me for follow up. My overall cholesterol was 170!! My doctor told me to keep taking these fish oil supplements but never more than once daily. He didn‚Äôt increase the statin dose either. These gel pills have a fishy smell, and are bigger than most. I take mine after lunch and have no fish tasting burps afterwards. I just ordered another bottle of these. Everyone is different with their results, but I have finally found something that works!"
" July 22, 2023", United States ,5,Victoryman63,üò≤ OMG,"If I could give it a 10 I would.
I'm 70 and have rheumatoid arthritis in my tail bone. I've tried turmeric and many other joint supplements with no results. I enjoy riding my motorcycle but it got where I couldn't go more than an hour without extreme pain. I haven't even gone through half a bottle of this krill oil and now can ride two hours and only get moderate pain. Hoping for more improvement with longer use."
" September 11, 2023", United States ,3,Bambi,Fresh catch?,"I gave a 3 star because I bought this brand 12 times (as opposed to a 1 star). This is the first time that I am having issues with it and trying to get through the bottle. I have never tasted the fish until now. Has the formula changed? It is very fishy. I'm trying to stay loyal, but Mega red looks good to me every time I take this."
" October 24, 2023", United States ,5,Mary,2nd bottle purchased,Seems to make a difference.
" June 20, 2023", United States ,4,William McDaniel,Pretty good product,Pretty good product. Have to a friend because it was a little bit fishy smelling and tasting
" August 6, 2022", United States ,4,Ron C,"No real complaints, seems high quality, honest review","I was experiencing swollen ankles and I heard krill oil helps circulation and can reduce ankle swelling. I have been taking these for a few weeks and my swelling is almost down to zero. That being said, at the same time I made other lifestyle changes, such as quitting drinking, no sugar, no gluten, and a general keto style diet. Are these pills contributing to my well-being? I can't say for sure, but I have been feeling better since making changes, and these pills were part of my change. One comment I want to be bluntly honest about is the strong taste and aroma. They do have an aftertaste of fish, and at times I can smell a strong krill oil odor when I urinate, or sometimes I'll wake up and taste krill, which goes away by brushing teeth and using mouthwash. As far as long term health improvement, time will tell."
" January 10, 2024", United States ,2,Manny,Where‚Äôs the higher EPA and DHA?,I‚Äôm disappointed to find a low amount of EPA and DHA considering its 2000mg of Krill Oil. I‚Äôve had 1000 mg with much more then this 2000 mg. The EPA in this one is 80 mg but others offer EPA of 135 for 1000 mg of Krill oil. Where is the benefit of more milligrams? I‚Äôm disappointed. I should have looked closer but I assumed it would have been better then a 1000 mg krill oil.
" July 20, 2023", United States ,5,jimmyd,Great Producy,I was having issues with my feet and ankles swollen so I read the reviews and saw that it had help customers with swelling. I purchase it a week and a half ago and started using it and my feet haven‚Äôt had any swelling and also some of the pain is gone. I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it.
" June 27, 2023", United States ,5,Ro,Great Omega 3‚Äôs,Doctor recommended Omega 3‚Äôs and I‚Äôve notice a difference since I started taking these daily. Moving from PNW to Arizona changed my diet. I love seafood! Here it‚Äôs not as easy to get. And more expensive with the shipping. I noticed a difference and after speaking to doctor started taking this Krill Oil and last blood work and checkup was told to continue doing whatever I am doing‚Ä¶so highly recommend this Krill Oil supplements for Omega 3‚Äôs and a healthy body.
" September 27, 2023", United States ,5,julio ulate,C√°psulas como suplemento alimenticio,Para los que no ingerimos suficiente omega3 creo que es un opcion bastante aceptable.
" November 23, 2023", United States ,1,BigDaddy13,Instead of 120 Krill Oil Pills I Got One Huge Stuck Together Pill,"Not happy at all with Antarctic Krill Oil Pills by Carlyle. Instead of getting 120 gel cap pills I got on giant stuck together pill which I guess is meant for King Kong to make sure he‚Äôs getting his Omega 3 in.

I had to get an ice pick to drill down into the bottle breaking a few gel caps so I could dump them in my hand. The problem with doing that is I pierced several pills causing a big red Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.

I would like a replacement to see if it was just an unlucky bottle or I deserve to get my money back. I‚Äôve been buying Kori Krill Oil and have never had an issue. I guess I should stick with what‚Äôs worked for me in the past.

Besides taking Krill Oil on a daily basis I also take a Tablespoon of Carlson Fish Oil along with 3 Tablespoons of Gaea Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I take a Tablespoon and a half in the morning along with my Carlson Fish Oil and another Tablespoon and a half of EVOO 30 minutes before dinner. I‚Äôm big into heart health adding 45 minutes of Cardio and 30 minutes or weight or resistance training 6 or 7 days a week. I don‚Äôt automatically take a day off. I listen to my body and if I feel tired or sore I may take a day off but the problem is I feel so good I rarely take that rest day. It does as much for my mental state as it does for my physical state."
" April 17, 2023", United States ,4,MC Vale,"Good option, but best take it at night, or you'll be burping the taste of fish","I love the fact that the ingredients are good. I love the fact that they are easy to swallow. But I recommend you take them at night, or after your last meal of the day. This way you won't be burping the taste of fish."

" December 30, 2022", United States ,4,Amazon customer,Fishy pill,"I bought this brand because it was way cheaper than Native Path brand. Very fishy smell and for an hour after taking it (even with a full meal), you have fish burps. Easy to swallow and a fraction of the price of other brands. Does the same thing as the expensive brands but the fish burps almost made me gag. On a positive note, it keeps my feet from swelling so much."
" July 27, 2023", United States ,3,Steve H.,Work decently but comes with Fishy smell and fish burps,"Good price for a decent product. Have been dealing with joint pain/athritis in knees for many years and this seems to help slightly along with a good diet. Biggest issues is that fish smell & fish burps from using this product. I have tried other brands that do not have this odor, maybe i got an old batch since a lot of reviews say they have not experiences it but I'll try another brand next time."

With potent Omega-3 EPA, DHA, and astaxanthin, this supplement is a powerhouse for overall health. The softgels are easy to swallow, without any fishy aftertaste. Sourced from pristine Antarctic waters, the purity is reassuring. I've experienced improved joint mobility, increased energy, and enhanced cognitive function. For a reliable and effective Omega-3 and astaxanthin supplement, I highly recommend Antarctic Krill Oil 2000 mg softgels."

" January 10, 2024", United States ,2,Manny,Where‚Äôs the higher EPA and DHA?,I‚Äôm disappointed to find a low amount of EPA and DHA considering its 2000mg of Krill Oil. I‚Äôve had 1000 mg with much more then this 2000 mg. The EPA in this one is 80 mg but others offer EPA of 135 for 1000 mg of Krill oil. Where is the benefit of more milligrams? I‚Äôm disappointed. I should have looked closer but I assumed it would have been better then a 1000 mg krill oil.

Everytime I take one I am burping up a terrible fish taste. It‚Äôs really awful. I hope they work for the purpose I bought them, but this fish taste is a bummer. 3 stars because of the fish taste."

The first bottle of 240 softgels I ordered in the summer of 2023 was very good, and I had no problems using the capsules daily. With the second order of 120 soft gels I ordered in December I was not so lucky. A couple of capsules had apparently leaked and all the gelsl capsules are stuck together. Tried separating them but they just burst. So I'm out the cost of a bottle of these Krill Oil gels and unfortunately I might have to reconsider what I order in the future."

" November 23, 2023", United States ,1,BigDaddy13,Instead of 120 Krill Oil Pills I Got One Huge Stuck Together Pill,"Not happy at all with Antarctic Krill Oil Pills by Carlyle. Instead of getting 120 gel cap pills I got on giant stuck together pill which I guess is meant for King Kong to make sure he‚Äôs getting his Omega 3 in.

I had to get an ice pick to drill down into the bottle breaking a few gel caps so I could dump them in my hand. The problem with doing that is I pierced several pills causing a big red Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.

I would like a replacement to see if it was just an unlucky bottle or I deserve to get my money back. I‚Äôve been buying Kori Krill Oil and have never had an issue. I guess I should stick with what‚Äôs worked for me in the past.

Besides taking Krill Oil on a daily basis I also take a Tablespoon of Carlson Fish Oil along with 3 Tablespoons of Gaea Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I take a Tablespoon and a half in the morning along with my Carlson Fish Oil and another Tablespoon and a half of EVOO 30 minutes before dinner. I‚Äôm big into heart health adding 45 minutes of Cardio and 30 minutes or weight or resistance training 6 or 7 days a week. I don‚Äôt automatically take a day off. I listen to my body and if I feel tired or sore I may take a day off but the problem is I feel so good I rarely take that rest day. It does as much for my mental state as it does for my physical state."

As soon as I opened the bottle, it had this terrible fishy smell which wasn't ever present in my previous purchases and not only that, now it has a terrible fishy after taste.
So, I immediately go to return this product just to discover it does not qualify for returns. So, they got one over on me and lost a customer in the process.
