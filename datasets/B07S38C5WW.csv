" December 28, 2023", United States ,5,Betty,Works like a charm!,I have tried many other brands and always come back to this one! Dissolve under tongue and feel sleepy around 25 minutes later. Tastes fine and I highly recommend. Side note‚Ä¶ have had occasions where I needed to change course and stay awake and was able to push through without a ton of drowsiness. Conclusion when you start to feel sleepy shut it down and let it do its job.
" December 2, 2023", United States ,5,Kate Maxwell,"Safe, Easy, Effective","The strawberry flavor, fast dissolving tablet is ideal for me. As a senior, it's vital that any sleep aid does not have side effects, as prescription meds may, that would put me at risk of falling when I need to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night."
" August 28, 2022", United States ,5,Crystal Matthews,Best Taste and Better than ANY Narcotic if 20+ years!,"Do NOT buy the 10mg the taste is bitter from I love the taste of this brand Natrol melatonin berry flavored! I love the fact that it dissolves in my mouth and taste like candy :-) it‚Äôs fast acting usually within 15 to 30 minutes max I am ready to pass out. And that‚Äôs coming from somebody who has a sleep deficiency where I only cycle 2 to 3 times if I‚Äôm lucky or is not as people say for 8 to 12 times. Which means I am never arrested! Plus on top of that I‚Äôve had insomnia since I was a newborn I‚Äôm not even joking my mom take me to the hospital as a baby because I would not fall asleep until the sun came up and then slept until 11 AM every day. She was so delirious she actually believed my doctors joke that I was a vampire! I have tried every narcotic out there you name it I‚Äôve taken it. Majority of our ties me to sleepwalk, some of them are causing me to sleep drive, some of them or hola me to wake up in the morning and I have been fired twice because of Ambien. Although that was early in my 20s. However this product is amazing! I do NOT recommend the 10 mg ones, it has a better taste because melatonin isn‚Äôt exactly that great tasting but the berry flavor covers that all up with the 5 mg and taste like a sweet treat right before bed! And has even improve the quality of my sleep, rather than waking feeling as if I‚Äôve gotten no sleep, my recent sleep study shows that I am cycling now twice as many times as before and all that so I‚Äôm not in the normal range it is getting better. I feel I owe it all to Natto!!"
" December 11, 2023", United States ,5,J. Foust,Best Melatonin I've tried!,"I've been taking these dissolvable melatonin tablets for about a year now and I love them! They dissolve fast and taste great. I usually take one about an hour before bedtime, and sleep so much better than I used to. I was a very restless sleeper that would sometimes take hours to fall asleep, but thanks to melatonin I fall asleep easily and get a good restful night's sleep. My one small issue with them is that I wake up a little groggier than usual, but I can usually shake that off after a few minutes."
" January 12, 2024", United States ,5,Jaime,Works great!,"I have a hard time sleeping so I take these pretty regularly. This was my second bottle. For me, it takes a while to kick in so I have to plan ahead and take it so I can be tired at the time I want to go to sleep. Its a good value and the tablets dissolve fast."
" August 23, 2023", United States ,4,Kat20,Works well,"I had clinical insomnia last fall and winter. My doctor recommended I use REMFresh. I tried it and it worked really well. However, the price skyrocketed to $75 and more.
The reviews for this melatonin product were very promising, but I am a skeptic‚Ä¶.
I am very happy with this product. I don‚Äôt sleep quite as deep as I did with the other, but I do return to a comfortable sleep easily when I have to get up during the night. Fortunately, it doesn‚Äôt leave me thick headed in the morning.
I would highly recommend this product. Monetarily there‚Äôs no contest. Effectiveness is wonderful.
I hope you get great results, too."
" December 25, 2023", United States ,5,Sarah,Best sleep ever,"I slept like a baby. Great taste, they dissolve in your mouth so no swallowing pills. Brings a lot of them for the price!! Worth it!"
" January 10, 2024", United States ,5,TheSHABANIMAL,Natrol Melatonin 5mg: A Five-Star Sleep Upgrade That Surpasses Expectations,"Having been a loyal user of the NOW melatonin brand for over a decade, I was hesitant to switch, but trying Natrol Melatonin 5mg has been a revelation, earning it a well-deserved five-star rating.

From the first night, I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of my sleep ‚Äì a peaceful and restful experience that I hadn't realized was missing. Initially skeptical, I attributed it to a possible fluke, but after consistently using Natrol Melatonin for two bottles now, I can confidently say it's no accident.

The effectiveness of Natrol Melatonin is consistent and reliable, making it an essential part of my nighttime routine. The transition from my previous brand has been seamless, and the positive impact on my sleep has been undeniable.

I wholeheartedly recommend the Natrol Melatonin 5mg to anyone seeking a reliable and effective sleep aid. It has surpassed my expectations, providing the serene and restorative sleep I've been longing for. In my book, it's a five-star game-changer!"
" December 2, 2023", United States ,5,Isabelle,Works and yummy,I break this in half and is all that I need whenever I can‚Äôt fall asleep. Sometimes I give like 1.25mg of it to my kids when they won‚Äôt sleep either and works like a charm. I didn‚Äôt have any side effects like headache etc as they said about taking melatonin.. this is the first I ever took this supplement and The first night I had half of the tablet it worked immediately.
" November 29, 2023", United States ,5,C Love,Sweet Dreams in a Flash,"My go-to solution for fast and efficient sleep aid. The quick-dissolve feature lives up to its name, providing a swift and effective way to prepare for a restful night. One of the standout features for me is the strawberry flavor. It is pleasant for adults, but it's also for kids. The enjoyable taste eliminates the struggle of convincing little ones to take it, turning bedtime into a smoother and more enjoyable routine.

" January 4, 2024", United States ,5,Crystal S,better than others,"I originally purchased these because I wanted a dissolving pill that did not contain red-40 in the ingredients. I have found a few other brands that don't have red-40 but this one is the best tasting one I have tried so far. (it's a bit more expensive, but I think its worth it)"
" January 13, 2024", United States ,5,Fixermun,Melt in your mouth sleep aid,"These melt in your mouth and are absorbed through the membranes in your mouth. I break them in half, and use as needed. The flavor is good."

" November 27, 2023", United States ,5,That guy,Just Perfect for Me,"This 5mg dosage of melatonin is perfect for me and Natrol is a high-quality brand I've been using for years.

It's not always easy to find 5mg melatonin. 10mg is a little too much for me and I wake up a little groggy. This dosage, brand and price point is perfect for me and I'll definitely re-order!"
" December 14, 2023", United States ,5,Laurie,They do the trick!,Hubby didn't want to take sleep meds because he's taking plenty of meds already. His sleep specialist suggested using these instead and they've been working quite well.
" November 11, 2023", United States ,5,LIDOBADABRA,Only one brand I rely on,"It‚Äôs melting while still in my mouth, that‚Äôs how I know it will be absorbed fast. And like many melatonin users I confirm, melatonin is not going to make you fall asleep faster. But the safe nightly routine will. After I‚Äôm already in bed and ready to spend 20 mins on my phone, I pop one or two in and bam, brain is signaled. I will be far calmer and ready to switch off for the day."

" October 16, 2023", United States ,5,Mark Lyle,Top Shelf,Puts me to sleep in less than a hour
" August 30, 2023", United States ,4,Christy,Contains xylitol,Beware of this product as it contains xylitol which is fatal even in small amounts to dogs and can be toxic to cats as well. I will no longer be buying this brand in the future but will opt for something unsweetened or differently sweetened. Every time I take one I worry my curious dog is going to to gobble one up if I drop it. Not worth the worry. There are so many other sugar alcohols‚Äîor even a small amount of real sugar‚Äîthat could be used instead. Not sure why xylitol.
" November 27, 2023", United States ,5,Anthony L. Stashak,Excellent product,Night time sleep helper!
" October 14, 2023", United States ,5,Jdlco,Great value!,Love the quick dissolve and better priced here than Walmart.
" October 1, 2023", United States ,4,J. Davis,Good product but sometimes damaged,"I‚Äôve been buying this brand melatonin product for quite awhile. It‚Äôs a good product, but every once in a while I get a bottle that has a more than acceptable amount that is broken into small pieces. Fortunately, it doesn‚Äôt happen too often."
" September 7, 2023", United States ,4,Site7000,New formula?,"I've ordered this product 12 times going back several years. The bottle I just received seems to have a new formulation. It dissolves much more slowly and the flavor is reduced. I'm not sure I like it, but it's not the end of the world. I've tried competitors and I really disliked their flavor, so I'll probably stick with this one."

" September 12, 2023", United States ,5,Kimberly P.,Works Great,I love this product and have used for a very long time to help me get to sleep . The taste is nice and my grandchildren will even take a small portion of 1 tablet so the taste is kid approved as well & it helps them off to sleep fairly quickly.
" October 4, 2023", United States ,5,George H. Jones,Best Melatonin product I have ever used.,"This is a product that you really should dissolve under your tongue. I takes about 10-15 minutes to work, then you feel ready to sleep! I generally sleep through the entire night!
ps- It tastes great!"
" August 16, 2023", United States ,5,NV Rush Fan,Dissolve on the Tongue & Relax!,"These little tablets are very effective. Once in a while I have a really hard time sleeping, and I just dissolve 3 or 4 on my tongue, lie down & relax, and in less than 30 minutes I‚Äôm off in dreamland. I try not to take them too often, because I read if you take melatonin too regularly, your body will stop making it naturally. But, for occasional sleeplessness, these tablets are really wonderful."
" October 19, 2023", United States ,5,CdA Ringleader,Best tasting chewable,I‚Äôve been using this brand for years. The effect is consistent and I sleep well using it
" February 7, 2021", United States ,5,Michelle,These are a MUST TRY for sleepless nights!,"After trying so many different brands and forms of melatonin, these are- hands down- the best... quality/effectiveness, taste and price. Due to chronic cervical and thoracic spine pain, C-PTSD and major anxiety and depressive disorders, I have a lot of difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep. In an attempt to get this under control without rx medications, I finally found what works best for me. My 21 year old son also takes them and agrees that they are the best tasting and most effective. These tablets start to kick in almost immediately, so be sure to take when you are truly ready to fall asleep- you will become drowsy before turning in and the benefits may wear off by the time you are ready. I take it once I am in bed. They are sweetened with xylitol, so no worries that you already brushed your teeth... xylitol is great for dental health and used in many dental health products. They taste soooo good, too! Unlike a couple of other fast dissolve tablets that I've tried. I sometimes need to take 2, but i start with one. They do also help me stay asleep when I do take them. I use the melatonin as a last resort when meditation, belly breathing, etc doesn't quite do the trick in order to not effect my body's natural melatonin production and to keep from needing an increased dose. I've never experienced groggy mornings from these either and feel well rested when I wake up. The price offered by this seller is outstanding and much lower per tablet for the same product offered by anybody else or anywhere else. Having been out of work for awhile now and unable to return for a few more months, I have to watch every penny that I spend, so I've taken the time to look around and this is the best value by quite a large margin. These melatonin tabs have really been a godsend...such a great product. I highly recommend if you also experience difficulty with sleep!"
" September 22, 2023", United States ,5,Erin,Regular purchase,We purchase this regularly in my house and take some nightly. It really helps to calm the mind and allow for a restful sleep. The taste is pleasant and the price is reasonable - no complaints here.
" September 3, 2023", United States ,5,SouthernGal,Can‚Äôt live without these !,I work night shift 5 nights a week 12 hours . I usually take 4 to 6 tabs and get a full days sleep to prepare me for an entire shift . I highly recommend these to anyone having trouble sleeping . ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
" March 12, 2021", United States ,5,Robynne Davidson,"This specific supplement tastes good, is safe, and helps to fall and stay asleep.","So, maybe someone else will laugh, most importantly, I guess is that this 73 years old retired ED nurse has finally stumbled on a supplement that helps me sleep. Been a clinical, and administrative RN for 50 years. I have chased a good nites (or days rest depending on shift worked) since I started college at 17. I‚Äôm a stress cadet, not so much anymore, I do miss the ED, my fav department.
Ok, so what is funny, ????? I also have a 2 lb pink feathered friend, my Moluccan, Clyde. Clyde is 11, I am his queen, my husband of 50 years is his nemesis. Clyde is considered a rescue, I found a wonderful aviary in Alabama, Deanie was Clyde‚Äôs first mama. Then the evil one adopted him, she was neglectful, and covered him up when he got loud. You can hear these guys from a mile in Malaysia, where the breed is from. I did not know Clyde‚Äôs level of anxiety, till a year after he came to live with us. Cockatoo‚Äôs are notorious for being dependent, and I think his condition was exacerbated by his adulthood. Anyway, he is a screamer. I researched and found that L theanine, an amino acid, and melatonin has been used as a mild tranquilizer. I found the recommendations for dosage, and he gets 15 mg dissolved in his water every day. A safe dose, diluted. It has brought a more peaceable environment for all who live here including Teddy the resident feral kitty. So, in case you know someone who has a similar screamer problem, you now are aware that it can be manageable. I like this brand, it‚Äôs local CA, and it helps me get to sleep, and it helps my birdie baby feel more calm."

" August 17, 2023", United States ,5,Timothy D. Miller,When you need a natural sleep remedy,"I drive a truck and need my sleep. I use the melatonin to get much needed sleep. They are easy to swallow, don‚Äôt leave an after taste. Work great. Good price.
I would highly recommend melatonin to customers"

" September 11, 2023", United States ,5,Marzia,My favorite üòç,This is one of my family's favorite melatonins. They taste delicious and work well for all of us. Recommended.
" September 12, 2023", United States ,5,D. Dickerson,These tablets dissolve easily in my mouth.,I love that they dissolve so easily. The flavor is good. There a good value for the money.
" June 24, 2023", United States ,5,GDPhotography,They actually work!,"Like anything, don't use these every day and you'll be fine. Use them every day and they won't work as well because your brain becomes desensitized. First time I took one, I remember waking the next morning and feeling so refreshed! This stuff is awesome. If you're struggling through a bad sleep spell, I recommend switching off between melatonin, nyquil, and benadryl, instead of taking just this. Good luck!"
" May 29, 2021", United States ,5,Elevenofus,use for sleep and covid!,"This is my favorite melatonin. The 5 mg tastes better than the 10. Plus I take 15 mg at night, so it is easy to let 3 dissolve in my mouth when I get into bed. More than 15 mg and I don't get as much deep sleep. (As per my fitbit.) Less than 15 mg and I don't get as much sleep. So you have to fiddle with the dose to get to your sweet spot.

Also my family used this when we had covid. We followed the high dose melatonin protocol. It totally worked. Adults in my house took 80 mg a day in 4 divided doses. (So 20 mg or 4 tablets, four times a day.) We were initially pretty sick but had quick results. We stayed on it for a full two weeks. We never got a cough. I even gave this to my elderly mother in law as a preventative when we had it bc she lived with us. She never got sick but I realized later that she did lose her sense of smell.

This exact product is available cheaper at my big box membership store, but I bought some at amazon when I wasn't able to get to the store.

I love Natrol stuff and buy whatever they sell. I hate to swallow pills and much prefer dissolvable ones. Helpful that it vegan as I have an allergy to meat and cannot have gelatin."
" January 31, 2023", United States ,5,Brysonator,Saved my life,"I have had bad experiences with melatonin in the past due to higher dosage amounts so I was hesitant to try these. But some recent work schedule changes caused me to need to start waking up at 3AM and naturally I have a hard time falling asleep at a decent time. This caused me some major sleep deprivation.

After purchasing these I started with just half dose of the 5mg and these things are life changing! I was actually able to fall asleep very early and get really good quality of sleep to my surprise. I now always have these on me if I have a hard time falling asleep! It takes me about 15-20 minutes to start feeling sleepy after taking my dose. I will definitely keep purchasing these for a long time."
" October 1, 2023", United States ,5,trishainseattle,great product,worked well!
" October 9, 2023", United States ,3,Amazon Customer,Asleep fast but...,This is a good product to get to sleep fast but doesn't keep me asleep for over 4 hours. I found the extended release works better for me and I sleep all night.

" August 4, 2023", United States ,5,MN gal,This product works great.,I take one gummy 30 mins. before bedtime and I go right to sleep. I don't have any groggy side affects and these taste great. A good product that I will buy again.

" April 8, 2023", United States ,5,lovebird@iglobal.net,"LARGER BOTTLE, FEWER TABLETS",I really like this melatonin because of how easily it dissolves. What I don't like is that it had a more compact bottle with 250 tablets and now the bottle is bigger and has 200 tablets. Makes no sense other than a marketing ploy to make you think you are getting more instead of 1/5 less than before. Boo to incredible shrinking products!!
" May 25, 2023", United States ,4,Bentou jawara,Sleep,Sometimes it works sometimes it don‚Äôt
" May 20, 2020", United States ,5,FaithfulShopper,Definitely helps during this UNPRECEDENTED time....,"I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I've been struggling with sorting due to the impact of Covid19. I'm not as active so I'm not sleeping as well. I did lots of research on the benefits of melatonin so I just needed to find the right brand. I went with this brand because it had a high start rating and good reviews... so here's mine:

Taste... like tang.... fake orange flavor, not the best; but not inedible

Dosage...I took advice from a lot of people and decided to start with 5mg ( broke this one in half). Did this for 3 to 4 days and noticed I stayed asleep a little longer. Went up to the full 10mg and went to sleep faster... not knocked out... just eased into it... woke up like clockwork around 630am, refreshed. So I thought I would try 15 mg. Why? Maybe I would go to sleep faster and sleep later. NOPE! I ended waking up every other hour and actually had a dream I could remember.
I've been consistent with 10mg for the past week and it's a good fit. I ease ease into a restful slumber... no more over üò¥ and up with a good attitude. My 350lb male friend was knocked out with only 5mg (I'm female, 40, 185 lbs). So I guess it definitely varies with each individual. I say start at 5mg and work up if needed."
" August 6, 2023", United States ,5,ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,These work well,Take one of these at bedtime and go lay down. Puts you right to sleep. Works well.
" May 28, 2023", United States ,5,Kris10,A great boost to help you sleep!!,These chewable sleep aids are the perfect amount of melatonin to help you fall asleep fast and stay asleep longer. They have a wonderful strawberry flavor and are easy to chew with no aftertaste. I would recommend these small tablets if you're looking for a natural way to aid in sleep.
" June 28, 2023", United States ,5,Amazon Customer Review,Melatonin dissolvable tabs,"Easy to take with pleasant taste. After using two nights scored over 80 per Fitbit, which is good sleep and felt more rested. I have familial advanced sleep phase syndrome, so hope the good results continue"
" May 2, 2023", United States ,4,J. Kirkland,Sleepy Time,The pills work good. But the flavor was not the best.
" August 9, 2023", United States ,5,Patricia Harden,easily dissolve,"easy to chew or let dissolve in your mouth
pleasant tasting"
" July 9, 2022", United States ,5,Amazon Customer,Works great for me,"No guarantees, but it works great for me, and no hangover in the morning. I know people who tell me melatonin doesn't work for them or they feel loopy in the morning. Too bad. I used to be able to get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep for years, but as I age, my metabolism has changed. My bladder has me having to get up several times in the night to relieve myself, for instance. Before I started taking melatonin, after getting up for the third time, I'd be wide awake and couldn't get back to sleep. With melatonin, this is not a problem - I get back to sleep right away. And like most stuff you buy on Amazon, you get more for less. If you have a problem with sleep, I recommend trying this. I hope it works for you."
" July 29, 2023", United States ,5,Scott,Great product!,"I like the fast dissolving tablets, they taste good and they help me fall asleep faster."

" August 15, 2023", United States ,5,Amazon Customer,Satisfied Customer,"Everything all okay, keep up the good work."
" January 23, 2023", United States ,5,nemisis,Great sleep aid!,"First of all do not swallow tablet, place one tablet in mouth and let it melt. This is the 5mg tablet my doctor recommended, and he indicated not to take more than 1 tablet each time. I would suggest you contact your doctor if you think you need more than that. I like the fact Melatonin is naturally produced by the human body for sleep. So unless there are any added substances that could be considered harmful, Natrol's Melatonin seems to be safe. Again, for me, my doctor recommended no more than one tablet each time used."

From the first night, I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of my sleep ‚Äì a peaceful and restful experience that I hadn't realized was missing. Initially skeptical, I attributed it to a possible fluke, but after consistently using Natrol Melatonin for two bottles now, I can confidently say it's no accident.

The effectiveness of Natrol Melatonin is consistent and reliable, making it an essential part of my nighttime routine. The transition from my previous brand has been seamless, and the positive impact on my sleep has been undeniable.

I wholeheartedly recommend the Natrol Melatonin 5mg to anyone seeking a reliable and effective sleep aid. It has surpassed my expectations, providing the serene and restorative sleep I've been longing for. In my book, it's a five-star game-changer!"

 As of September 2023, THIS PRODUCT NO LONGER WORKS.

I have been taking Natrol Melatonin for 5 years. They recently changed the label slightly, and reduced the serving count from 250 to 200‚Ä¶but the worst part is it went from being 100% to 0% effective for me and two of my family members.

It is not kicking in before bed, or in the middle of the night when I wake up and take it. My girlfriend concurs.

It isn‚Äôt just me saying this, but my father, who separately subscribes to this product at a different address, concurs. It is not the same as it used to be.

Something may be wrong with the recent manufacturing of this product. I hope they figure it out."
