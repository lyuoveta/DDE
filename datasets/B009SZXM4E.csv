" May 26, 2023", United States ,5,Alba,Unlock Your Beauty Potential with Nature's Bounty Biotin,"I am excited to share my experience with Nature's Bounty Biotin on Amazon. This product has truly been a game-changer for enhancing the health and beauty of my hair, skin, and nails.

Nature's Bounty Biotin, with its potent 10,000 mcg dosage, has played a significant role in improving the condition of my hair. Prior to using this supplement, my hair was dull and lacked vitality. However, after incorporating Nature's Bounty Biotin into my daily routine, I have noticed a remarkable transformation. My hair feels stronger, shinier, and more resilient, and I am delighted with the visible reduction in hair breakage.

Not only has Nature's Bounty Biotin benefited my hair, but it has also had a positive impact on my skin. I have struggled with skin issues, including dullness and occasional breakouts. However, since taking these rapid-release softgels, my skin has become noticeably clearer and more radiant. I attribute this improvement to the nourishing effects of biotin, which supports the production of healthy skin cells.

Furthermore, Nature's Bounty Biotin has played a significant role in strengthening my nails. Previously, my nails were brittle and prone to breakage, which was both frustrating and unappealing. Thanks to this supplement, my nails have become stronger and less prone to chipping, allowing them to grow longer and healthier.

The rapid-release softgel form of Nature's Bounty Biotin is a convenient and easy way to incorporate this supplement into my daily routine. It ensures quick absorption, maximizing the benefits of biotin for hair, skin, and nails.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Nature's Bounty Biotin to anyone looking to enhance the health and appearance of their hair, skin, and nails. With its powerful formula and proven results, this supplement is a fantastic addition to any beauty regimen. Unlock your beauty potential with Nature's Bounty Biotin and experience the transformative effects for yourself"
" January 2, 2024", United States ,5,dolores macias-cha,Good value,I've taken biotin for yrs. Started purchasing on Amazon due to better price & ease of auto delivery. I believe this product has improved the quality & texture of my hair plus the thickness has increased.
" February 19, 2022", United States ,5,Elizabeth L,Works every time for fast hair growth,"Without fail my hair growth is bananas. At one time I‚Äôd stopped taking these to test if it was the vitamin or hair care that helped. For a while my hair growth was like at a standstill. Suddenly seemed like even half inch was difficult to get to. I also realized as I just turned a late 40ish years old, that I have a bit of hair thinning at least towards my bangs/widows peak area. Now I wouldn‚Äôt mind not having a widows peak, but I‚Äôve always had one. Supposedly you‚Äôre either born with the gene from the fathers side of genetics, or a widows peak due to balding later in life. The bit of thinning is very likely due to medications I take such as blood pressure meds. So since I can‚Äôt stop the meds, I started biotin back up. I have tried other mixed vitamins before that has biotin, and what felt like no results. Now usually in winter my hair growth isn‚Äôt as much but I started this vitamin and also a general vitamin D. So far, just by it being obvious as I‚Äôm not measuring my hair but it‚Äôs very obvious the past few months my hair is having a growth spurt. I also know because I have to shave my legs more often again. Now this may only be me but this specific biotin I take 1x daily in the morning and with the same brand I take 1x daily vitamin D. My hair growth sped up for sure. I know it‚Äôs said that peoples hair only grows like 1/4-1/2‚Äù per month, well just guessing if my hair was growing 1/4‚Äù then it absolutely went to more. If I had to guess, if it‚Äôs possible my hair growth is more like 3/4-1‚Äù per month. Again maybe that‚Äôs not physically possible but it‚Äôs obvious him at then the highest amount of growth. I also don‚Äôt have much shedding like I had been. I have normal shedding in the shower.

I‚Äôm still working also on weight loss so I‚Äôm trying some generic gummies of apple cider vinegar which is supposed to help for many things but I just started those this week.

The other things I do that work for me is I forget the brand but I‚Äôm using a very popular wet/dry hair brush. I have 2 of them so one I have hooked up in my shower and one in a drawer. I use the one in the shower to gently brush conditioner through my hair. I only use conditioner mid shaft to ends. I don‚Äôt want to have my hair oily so my bangs area to midshaft I only use a tiny bit like a dime or quarter size and I don‚Äôt get any conditioner purposely on my scalp. I have to wash my hair and scalp very throughly until I see no suds at the drain. If conditioner residue is on my scalp I tend to sweat in sleep. I don‚Äôt use the same shampoo and conditioner every time and just have several in my shower, usually using Hask brand. I use all of their scents. I have a ton of different brands but I keep going back to Hask. I cannot use a conditioner that I have a hard time brushing thorough and that brand works great for me. I use usually shampoos and conditioners that have biotin and caffeine in them with collagen."

" December 7, 2023", United States ,5,Karina Castro,One month apart photo hair update,"I started taking these in July after I chopped my hair off just past my shoulders, one a day but if I forgot then I‚Äôd take 2 or 3 a day sometimes. Decent pill size to swallow and didn‚Äôt really taste like anything. I finished my bottle in early November and am taking other biotin pills by Spring Valley just to switch it up. My hair appears thicker and seems to be grow within those 4 months, maybe very slowly. My nails are also strong too and grow pretty fast they dont bend or break as easy. Didn‚Äôt notice any difference in my skin though.
Side note: I get a trim once every 8-10 weeks because I use a lot of heat on my hair and get split dead ends, I‚Äôm in need of another soon üòÖ"

After about 6 months of use, I realized that I haven't had a cracked or split nail in months. I've had weak, peeling, breakable nails my entire life. Now my nails are so strong that they practically feel reinforced. I'm even dealing with a surprise side effect; I move a lot in my sleep and I've accidentally scratched my face a couple of times with my new, super-strong nails!"
" October 14, 2023", United States ,5,Shelly,Love this biotin,"I have been using nature's bounty biotin for over 8 years. I love how it makes my nails and hair grow fast. I recently reordered and received the product with a yellow-ish gel cap color. In the past, it used to be a solid white gel cap. I called the company and spoke with a representative from nature's bounty. She advised that the gel cap is now a translucent yellow . They changed it from the solid white. I was very concerned thinking that the product had spoiled in transit as the Amazon trucks can be very hot

I highly recommend taking this. Please note you will see results with consistent use."

" August 1, 2023", United States ,4,"Just, like, my opinion man",The jury's still out.,"To my horror, my hair started falling out after having to take two courses of prednisone for an inflamatory condition/flare-up. I've always had LOTS of hair, but now have to do a comb-over to cover the almost-bald spots on my scalp. After finishing a full bottle of this product, I can't say there is a noticeable difference. My nails remain the same as ever, and I can't tell if there is significant hair regrowth where I need it. On the plus side, I haven't lost any more hair. Will try one more bottle of this stuff to see if it helps. If not, the next step
is minoxodil."

I'm an otherwise healthy 20 year old, so you would understand my shock when I found out I was losing chunks of my hair and there wasn't much I could do besides see my dermatologist and try some hair growth remedies. I tried biotin shampoos, didn't seem to work. I tried putting oil in my hair, too messy BUT it did make my hair sleek. I took my prescribed meds + these biotin supplements and YOU GUYS..my hair is pretty much all grown back and my nails grew so much faster and stronger! Not sure how well it works on skin since I already have clear skin, but I've read some positive things about it helping with that too. I completely recommend these supplements!! I know I'll be buying more, don't say I didn't put you on."
" September 4, 2023", United States ,5,Philip Ho,"Good Value, No Mess and No Toil for Hair Enhancement","I was skeptical about hair enhancement products even though I had been looking for effective solutions since I am losing hair. I did not want to try spray or rub-on products because they tend to be messy and requires effort to use. Some products are also quite expensive. I decided to give these Biotin capsules a try. I have been taking them 4 times a week for 6 months now. Two results are very noticeable: some new, thin, black hair have grown, especially around my forehead, and surprisingly, in my eyebrows too; my finger and toe tails have been growing faster, so my black toenails from hiking are now replaced with healthy ones. These Biotin capsules are inexpensive and requires no effort other than opening my mouth. As long as you keep proper expectations, you will be satisfied with this product."

" May 13, 2020", United States ,4,JANS reviews,Hair is actually growing,"so for last year my son was experiencing hair thinning and even hair loss around the crown area. It was very severe and after ignoring the issue for several months with the hope it would grow back I felt I had to take matters into my own hands as I feel that it's causing him self esteem issues. My son is 16 years old. Typical teen, fairly healthy, does not eat well, has not been drinking water. We took him for his annual check-up. Doc said he was fine but if we wanted to he could go and have blood test to see if there's a thyroid issue (we still have to do this). Anyway fast forward six months. A few months ago we bought the hair max laser device and biotin gummies. He uses device sporadically even though I constantly hound him and offer to do it for him. We didn't really see much of a difference. He took gummies but again sporadic at best. So now we are under quarantine. Hubby felt we should go chemical route. I said absolutely not. He's still young and developing. I decided let's change things up a bit. Starting with his meals I am trying to introduce more biotin rich food - Typical breakfast is omelette with mushrooms and yellow bell peppers. Snack is handful of walnuts. Smoothie consisting of banana, strawberries, and handful of spinach. Several glasses of water per day. Couple of times a week I give him juice (carrots, apples and celery). Normal lunch and dinner but also trying to introduce different fruit and vegetables each day. He's actually enjoying most of the food that I've given him. I've also added these biotin pills and still hounding him to do hair max. Within one week we saw a difference. It really is a miracle but still a work in process. He forgets to drink water. He is on board with the food. He's really trying with veggies. Not a fan of juices but loves the smoothies. Not sure what has contributed to hair growth. Maybe a combo of all of this. I also wanted to massage his scalp but he won't let me. I hope this helps you. Don't give up. Definitely revamp diet."

I lost 1/3 to 1/2 of my hair after Covid and massive clots two years ago and now my hair is thicker than ever. My hairdresser has been noting the improvement over the last two years. In fact, I even bought her the Biotin kit of 7 essentials. It's the best by Defeel Co."

My hair is fine, and so it tangles easily and i lose a lot of it when im showering or brushing it. Biotin and collage have seriously helped with the loss, and also my skins health. I also have a 10 step skin care routine, but the supplements have made it more even and improved the elasticity of it. I definitely recommend this product!!

Easy to swallow"
" December 10, 2023", United States ,3,Wendy Royce,Not sure yet,I started taking Biotin to help my nails. I haven't seen much improvement yet. I will take it a little longer and see if my nails improve at all.
" March 14, 2022", United States ,4,Briayanah Sparks,So far so good.,"Back Story:
I'm definitely gonna be updating this when I get my hair pressed and trimmed but, the picture üì∏ attached is my hair exactly 11 weeks ago before the biotin. I started this hair growth challenge against my mom and we are in a competition.

I got this dosage as a recommendation from the hair stylist that kicked off our race (Giving us our starting press &trim).
Initial Reaction:
I'm actually very pleased with the changes i have noticed so far and can't wait to see if I'll gain more benefits or hit a plateau.

The pill is super small and way easy to swallow. I'm not a fan of the smell but, it isn't strong at all. It's extremely faint. A normal person would have to stick their nose in the bottle to be able to smell it. I'm just very sensitive to smells. I have never actually tasted it (i generally keep any pills in between my teeth then swallow it down with water to avoid tasting it just in case it's an unsavory taste) so, I wouldn't be able to describe a flavor.

Now I know my hair has grown since then. My hair is not much thicker (still only been 11 weeks so we will see) but, definitely noticeably longer. Even my nails aren't as brittle and don't break off nearly as often. I know this because, I check my nails on a regular basis and will even do a bend test to check their durability.

I haven't noticed much of a difference in skin but being as though I only started taking it for hair growth. Im not really looking for a change in that department but, I'll keep taking it and see what happens.

Until Next time (typed on 03/14/2022)..."

" June 19, 2023", United States ,5,PR HUNTER,Bad Batch??? NO!!!,"If you order this product, please note that after contacting Nature's Bounty directly, after receiving a replacement from Amazon with same color as ordered; I have been informed that the color change is because of a ""reformulation"" of the softgel. In other words, they had to make a revision to the ingredients, and that is why there was a color change. It is still the same great product it has been for many years, as well as Nature's Bounty reputation. So glad I researched this...not only for my peace of mind, but for other consumers and Amazon. Of course, this has nothing to do with Amazon as they are just the middle person. Bottles have no tamper evidence at all! Thank you Amazon and Nature's Bounty. Pls note picture with NEW COLOR"
" April 27, 2023", United States ,5,Amazon Customer,Easy to swallow,"MY UPDATED REVIEW: Its now been just over 3-months since I started taking this & I am SOOO happy as 1-WEEK ago I have noticed a significant favorable change in my hair growth. Not only do I see baby hairs sprouting along my hairline but they are GRAY which proves that this product indeed works! I color my hair & haven't had to do my facial hairline because there wasn't any regrowth for at least 8-months & after showering I couldn't believe how much hair I was loosing in this area. NOW just the normal (few) amount is on the shower floor! I'm 78 y/o & my hair has always been my crowning glory, so when I started loosing it noticeably I became devastated. Don't bother with all the shampoo hair growth products until you take & give Biotin a chance. I'm taking 10k mcg daily which I checked with my doctor first for approval. NO problems, NO side effects, just good results!"
" July 7, 2023", United States ,4,RPG and GST,"Not sure of benefits claimed, but recommended by friends & doctor","Since taking this for a couple of years I thought I had a return of some eyelashes and less hair loss post menopause. It may also be that my nails are stronger. The differences are subtle, and not as dramatic as some friends report, but better something than nothing. Tiny gel capsules, easy to swallow, no flavor."
" September 15, 2023", United States ,5,Reality A.,the very best biotin for your body,"beautiful hair and nails are guaranteed when you take this supplement. I started taking it several years ago and now I can tell you that my hair is long and lustrous and my nails always look gorgeous long and strong without any extra effort, other than taking this pill; in my daily vitamin regimen. this brand works great. best price I've found is here on Amazon"
" October 3, 2023", United States ,5,Kendra,Biotin helps my Hair,I am a huge fan of biotin. I can tell a major difference in my hair and nails when I take this supplement. Overall I recommend it to anyone and everyone!
" August 24, 2023", United States ,5,Janto2,OMG! Hair thinning!,"Took this for years, along with a handful of complimentary vitamins, but it really didn't help to grow any hair back...except maybe on my legs and lady chin. However, it very well could have helped keep in the hair I do have. I have switched to an all-in-one vitamin, so if it don't grow on top, maybe my beard will grow long enough to style on top of my head!"
" October 4, 2023", United States ,5,Debra R,Works well,Been taking these every day for years. I barely lose any hair after I wash it. You Must give them time!! Eventually they kick in & I highly recommend.
" June 5, 2023", United States ,5,John Shannonhouse,"This works, but takes time","My fingernails began breaking and cracking really frequently some time after I finished cancer treatment. I assume there must be some connection.

Looking at the nails before use, you could see the nails were a bit reddish with lots of grooves where cracks and breaks could develop. I ordered these. As the nails grew out, the color became more normal from the bottom up. There was still significant breaking as the bad part of the nails grew out, but you could see the healthy are drowning towards the top. The last of the bad area is currently finishing, there is less breakage, and ai can see the final result of normal healthy nails."

" August 16, 2023", United States ,5,Alycia Lykins,Hair Growth Magic !,My hair grows an 1/2 inch or more a month when taking this every day. I‚Äôve taken this for years. A year ago I had a bad bleach incident and lost inches‚Ä¶ I started taking this right after and my hair grew back long and stronger than before and it only proved that it actually works!
" January 15, 2023", United States ,4,Sandra H.,Works Great for Some People,"This supplement works great for my husband who is almost 70 and he noticed that his hair, especially eyebrows are returning to their brown color. He hasn‚Äôt noticed that his hair is any thicker (which is the primary reason we purchased this product) but he‚Äôs very happy that his gray hair seems to be darkening. I tried the supplement for about two weeks and started having stomach issues (which I later read is a side effect for some people). He has never had any stomach sensitivity so he‚Äôs going to continue using it. I noticed that the average amount of biotin is typically 1000-5000 mg so at 10,000 mags, this is definitely a mega dose. I was hoping to improve my skin and nails, so I may find one to try at a small dose that will not cause stomach upset."

" January 2, 2024", United States ,1,Lori Weyant,Product defective - Amazon won't replace or refund,"I have been taking this Nature's Bounty Biotin supplement for over 10 years and haven't had any issues with purchasing it through Amazon. This most recent purchase in late December 2023 is not the same product that I have been using. I opened the bottle and there is a foul smell to the gel caps and they are discolored. The expiration date is in 2026, so this must be a bad batch or has not been stored properly. Amazon has denied returning or replacing these and suggested I contact Nature's Bounty directly. I did that. Since these were fulfilled by Amazon Services, Nature's Bounty will not replace them either. It seems I am stuck with a bad product that I cannot use. I will no longer purchase this brand anywhere ."
