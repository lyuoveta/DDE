THIS prescribed AMOUNT OF Vitamin D, IS WAY TOO MUCH!   By the way, the majority of doctors have the equivalent of a one half hour course, in nutritional education, IF THAT, included in their schooling.   Food is medicine.   Having said this, I will proceed with my personal experience, and knowledge, about Vit.D.  I take Vit.D because, it is SO IMPORTANT for our overall hea,lth. I am 53 years old, and take a heart medicine, (called Atenolol,) which does not allow me to go out in the Sun. So, I have to take a Vit.D supplement. I take 400 I.U. (or 10mcg) of D3, everyday.   (600 I.U. is the RDA, or the Recommended Daily Allowance, for people over the age of 70.)  Vit.D is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to the normal functioning of our bodies, and plays a large part in keeping us Cancer-free, as well.   Our bodies, continuously, scan through EVERY CELL in our entire body. When this scanning mechanism encounters a cell with a ""bite out of it,"" (due to exposure to radiation, through x-rays, etc.,) or other mutation, it replicates this abnormal cell, and this is one of the ways Cancer occurs.  Vit.D keeps this from happening. That's why it is SO important.   When we have healthy Vit.D levels, the mechanism that scans each and every cell, can recognize the mutated cell, or the cell with ""the bite out of it's DNA,"" that is faulty, and NOT replicate it.  It, instead, discards the cell from our body, and we stay healthy.    15 minutes of DAILY sunshine is, generally, enough for Caucasians to get the amount of needed Vit.D. African Americans, and those with more pigment in their skin, need a few more minutes, (if sunlight is allowed.)  In addition to this, scientists have recently learned that, Vit.D (in larger doses, and over an extended period of time,) is extremely beneficial, in fighting the COVID-19 coronavirus, in it's early stages.   Vit.D is essential for normal growth and development.  It promotes the use of calcium and phosphorus in the formation of our bones and teeth. It is especially needed for infants, children, and women, during pregnancy, and lactation.   In mild cases, results of lack or deficiency of Vit.D, are the interference with utilization of calcium and phosphorus in bone and teeth formation.  Irritability, and weakness are also results of a lack, or deficiency, of Vit.D.  Severe deficiency leads to rickets.  Valuable sources of Vit.D, are Sunlight and Fish-liver oil. Low concentrations are found in egg yolk, cream and butter.  Milk may be enriched with it, (but, 1 quart of whole milk, fortified with V.itamin D, only equals 400 I.U.) Ultraviolet rays from special lamps, acting on the skin, are another way to get Vit.D.  Lesser, or trace, amounts can be found in (fortified) yeast and sea vegetables (Nori, Dulse, etc.)  Natural food sources of Vitamin D are meager.    If one chooses to use Fish Oil, keep it under refrigeration, as that is where it is stable.   We store Vit.D. in our liver.   Again, the Recommended Daily Allowance is 400 I.U. until the age of 70 years old.  Then, the (RDA) Recommended Daily Allowance, goes up to 600 I.U.   I am a Vegetarian.   So, additionally, I take B12, along with my Vit.D, DAILY.   I, also, eat Iron, DAILY, as well, through Natural, Organic, Whole Food Sources, like:  Egg Yolk, Beans, Oatmeal, Raisins, Apricots, Peaches, Prunes, Molasses, Peas, Green Leafy Vegetables, Almonds and Soy Beans.   ~Note:  If you take a Calcium - Magnesium Complex:    Calcium (1,000mg.) - Magnesium (500mg.)  *We can ONLY absorb 600mg. of Calcium, at a time.

Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create ,toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested follow,ing).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.    I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.

From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.      One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions.

I felt like my skin had been removed and i had immense swelling to my hips and thighs. i gained 7 pounds of fluid and could barely walk. I could only sleep with Benadryl. bc of the holidays and weekend, i couldn't, see my doctor until Monday. I was so desperate and thought it was fungal, I looked for some Lotrimin but couldn't find any in the cabinet. I did find some Colloidal Silver 10ppm that my husband had bought a couple of years ago. When he bought it, I was highly skeptical but I sprayed it on in desperation due to the pain and irritation. I used my forearm as a test site.  In ten minutes my forearm was clearer and I sprayed it again. I walked the dog for 15 minutes and the rash on my forearm was gone. I sprayed it on my shoulders, hips, thighs, and knees with relief in about 30 minutes. Of course, the swelling has not subsided in this immediate period but, I am confident that it will be gone soon enough. I left my chest unsprayed as a test and it continues to be red, swollen, painful, and itching.

I used CS on my cat's facial abscess and it healed in the course of 5 days with no outer intervention, no surgery or drain tubes   Not only did the wound completely heal and the skin grow back but the HAIR grew back as well.  Anyone with pets knows this doesn't happen when surgery and FDA meds are involved.

I'm frustrated to find the ridiculous statements in this article dissuading people who might otherwise be able to form their own opinion as well.  If you aren't allergic to silver, ask your doctors before hand if they have objections to you trying it on something simple: a inflamed cuticle or skin abrasion. I guarantee your doctor will say ""it's not going to hurt you to try"" and then you will see first hand the amazing quality of silver in the biological environment.  My doctor actually uses the silver water I make her.

In short, unexpectedly I find it to be a good pain and itch killer for skin lesions!    But it is NOT effective for treatment or prevention of acne. Okay for folliculitis (infection of hair follicle). I haven't taken it internally so far.  And that's about all I have tried it for so far.

Unfortunately,eight years ago she had a stroke and heart attack that really beat her down. Then ,due to us using sucralose sweetener (spenda) in all her beverages her stomach stopped digesting water. Then her HMO treated her dehydration by messing up her heart medicine ,which blinded her by making her cataracts eighty percent worse in three weeks and giving her a, dose of reglan that blew her brain to pieces.  Thankfully, I found the sucralose problem we stopped using it- it still took two months for her stomach to heal to accept plain water and we had to wait five months for the cataract surgery.  That cataract surgery saved her life. Still most of the heart blood medicines they gave her really effected her brain. This all happened over the last four years. We had some krill oil in the fridge and she was really heading into a bad place so I said lets try this.  The krill oil is simply a miracle. Her brain is coming back to life. Her sores on the front of her legs is getting much smaller. She still suffers greatly but the trend is heading in a positive direction. She takes a very large dose. Three 800 mg in the morning and three 800 mg at night. There is no stomach discomfort and the krill oil is miles more effective then fish oil. She's on lasix for water retention,krill oil which is saving her life and quality of life as well as magnesium picolenate.zinc picolinate,b vitamin supplements and cranberry pills( vitamin c) to fight urinary tract infections.  We are in the fight now. She's also maintains her diabetes will the proper shots too. Buy a quality krill oil and be sure its krill oil.

845,2014-04-28,Melatonin,44,6,Other,3.7,"Benzodiazepines cause tolerance and physical dependence within two to four weeks, and, upon cessation acute withdrawal traditionally requires tapered management. Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.  ol  For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme cauti,on and for very short periods.    Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.    To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)    My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.    It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).    Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome.     Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.

936,2010-01-14,Melatonin,54,60,Circadian rhythm sleep disorders,4.0,"Had non 24-hour sleep-wake disorder for twenty years.  I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certa,in kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.

I decided against taking prescription medication and after browsing and reading I chose a supplement I wanted to try:  Biotin.

I was even amazed that all these little baby hairs were sprouting along my hairline and bangs. I was literally growing a new hairline back. All these new hairs started sprouting along my hairline and my bangs were thicker which blew my mind. My nails were growing like weeds and were a LOT thicker. Also I noticed my skin was changing for the better. The dry spots on my face were gone and I even developed a glow from my skin. I was beyond satisfied with this product.

After taking Wellbutrin for abouta year, I noticed gradual hair loss.  I stopped taking it and felt desperate to regain my thick hair.  I choose to buy Biotin 10,000 to speed up the process; big mistake!!!  Within a few months,  my scalp became itchy.  I sought treatment and help, but no doctor could determined be the cause.  I was told to use dandruff shampoo, which never helped.  A f,ew months later, I began having itchy patches on my body; mainly my elbows, knees, low back, outter thighs and my stomach.  Again, I asked a few doctors for help and was told that I have Ecezma for the first time in my life.  I used the steroid cream without much relief, so began feeling hopeless and depressed.  The itching is so bad that I rarely get a good nights sleep.      Long story short, I threw out all of my vitamins, thinking it had to be an allergic reaction to one of them.  The only one I kept was the biotin 10,000.  As my itching didn’t subside, I finally realized that it must be the biotin.  I did some on-line research and found that doses over 2,500 can cause skin eruptions, itchy rash and scalp!!!!  I have stopped taking it, and the it hi g is slowly becoming less severe.

I began taking Biotin about 6 months ago. For the first 3 months, I felt my hair was thickening, but only slightly. I figured I needed additional help so I began taking some of the supplements listed in the famous Bargello's Vitamin Regimen (Google it). I have taken a multivitamin for many years along with a Vitamin D supplement, so I added MSM, Evening Primrose, and Fla,xseed Oil to my regimen. (No real science to my choice of products; I just went to Natural Grocers and stopped buying after my total reached $40.) I also added Vitamin B-12, based on some online reading. I have not added iron although some sources suggest it might be helpful. I have had no side effects at all, except -- about a month after adding the supplements, I experienced the worst shed of my life. My hair line receded (even more) and my hair thinned all over my scalp. With some careful teasing, artful arranging of the hair, generous application of Toppik, and lots of hairspray to keep everything in place, I was able to camouflage the shed enough to ride things out. It took about a month of misery and self-consciousness, but now my hair is growing in thicker than it has since I was a youngster! My hairline is filling in and there are no thin spots anywhere on my scalp, and the hair that is coming in is not the thin, fragile hair you get after your hair follicles have practically shut down, but robust medium-coarse hair and with no shedding to speak of -- I see only about 5 hairs in the sink after I comb my hair and arrange it, when I used to see at least 20-30.

I no longer worry about whether my hair is arranged properly to cover all the balding areas, I no longer worry about going out in the wind or the rain or the sun -- all of which can reveal thinning hair. And, I look so much younger with a full head of hair. It really seems like a miracle, because now I have completely normall,y thick hair after having had badly thinning hair for approximately 45 years! Here is the additional information I wanted to share: (1) As I have continued to use biotin, my hair has continued to thicken and it just never seems to shed any more. (2) I use whatever kind of biotin is available, not necessarily a particular brand name. Lately, I have been buying ""Nature's Bounty"" from Sam's Club. (3) I take one (1) 10,000 mcg gelcap-type dose per day. (4) You must tell your doctor you are taking biotin -- make sure the information is entered on your chart, because the use of biotin can affect the results of your blood tests. I had told my doctor I was taking biotin and it was on my chart, but when I went in for my most recent physical and lab tests, the doctor called back and said my thyroid function looked a little off, which he said might have been due to the biotin, and he had me stay off the biotin for four (4) days and then come back in and take the test again (which was fine). So, do tell your doctor you are taking biotin, and lay off the biotin for several days before you go in for lab tests so you don't have to repeat the test the way I did.
