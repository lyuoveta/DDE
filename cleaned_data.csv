1,B009SZXM4E,2023-05-26,Unlock Your Beauty Potential with Nature's Bounty Biotin,5.0,"I am excited to share my experience with Nature's Bounty Biotin on Amazon. This product has truly been a game-changer for enhancing the health and beauty of my hair, skin, and nails.

Nature's Bounty Biotin, with its potent 10,000 mcg dosage, has played a significant role in improving the condition of my hair. Prior to using this supplement, my hair was dull and lacked vitality. However, after incorporating Nature's Bounty Biotin into my daily routine, I have noticed a remarkable transformation. My hair feels stronger, shinier, and more resilient, and I am delighted with the visible reduction in hair breakage.

Not only has Nature's Bounty Biotin benefited my hair, but it has also had a positive impact on my skin. I have struggled with skin issues, including dullness and occasional breakouts. However, since taking these rapid-release softgels, my skin has become noticeably clearer and more radiant. I attribute this improvement to the nourishing effects of biotin, which supports the production of healthy skin cells.

Furthermore, Nature's Bounty Biotin has played a significant role in strengthening my nails. Previously, my nails were brittle and prone to breakage, which was both frustrating and unappealing. Thanks to this supplement, my nails have become stronger and less prone to chipping, allowing them to grow longer and healthier.

The rapid-release softgel form of Nature's Bounty Biotin is a convenient and easy way to incorporate this supplement into my daily routine. It ensures quick absorption, maximizing the benefits of biotin for hair, skin, and nails.

In conclusion, I highly recommend Nature's Bounty Biotin to anyone looking to enhance the health and appearance of their hair, skin, and nails. With its powerful formula and proven results, this supplement is a fantastic addition to any beauty regimen. Unlock your beauty potential with Nature's Bounty Biotin and experience the transformative effects for yourself"
2,B009SZXM4E,2024-01-02,Good value,5.0,I've taken biotin for yrs. Started purchasing on Amazon due to better price & ease of auto delivery. I believe this product has improved the quality & texture of my hair plus the thickness has increased.
3,B009SZXM4E,2022-02-19,Works every time for fast hair growth,5.0,"Without fail my hair growth is bananas. At one time I’d stopped taking these to test if it was the vitamin or hair care that helped. For a while my hair growth was like at a standstill. Suddenly seemed like even half inch was difficult to get to. I also realized as I just turned a late 40ish years old, that I have a bit of hair thinning at least towards my bangs/widows peak area. Now I wouldn’t mind not having a widows peak, but I’ve always had one. Supposedly you’re either born with the gene from the fathers side of genetics, or a widows peak due to balding later in life. The bit of thinning is very likely due to medications I take such as blood pressure meds. So since I can’t stop the meds, I started biotin back up. I have tried other mixed vitamins before that has biotin, and what felt like no results. Now usually in winter my hair growth isn’t as much but I started this vitamin and also a general vitamin D. So far, just by it being obvious as I’m not measuring my hair but it’s very obvious the past few months my hair is having a growth spurt. I also know because I have to shave my legs more often again. Now this may only be me but this specific biotin I take 1x daily in the morning and with the same brand I take 1x daily vitamin D. My hair growth sped up for sure. I know it’s said that peoples hair only grows like 1/4-1/2” per month, well just guessing if my hair was growing 1/4” then it absolutely went to more. If I had to guess, if it’s possible my hair growth is more like 3/4-1” per month. Again maybe that’s not physically possible but it’s obvious him at then the highest amount of growth. I also don’t have much shedding like I had been. I have normal shedding in the shower.

I’m still working also on weight loss so I’m trying some generic gummies of apple cider vinegar which is supposed to help for many things but I just started those this week.

The other things I do that work for me is I forget the brand but I’m using a very popular wet/dry hair brush. I have 2 of them so one I have hooked up in my shower and one in a drawer. I use the one in the shower to gently brush conditioner through my hair. I only use conditioner mid shaft to ends. I don’t want to have my hair oily so my bangs area to midshaft I only use a tiny bit like a dime or quarter size and I don’t get any conditioner purposely on my scalp. I have to wash my hair and scalp very throughly until I see no suds at the drain. If conditioner residue is on my scalp I tend to sweat in sleep. I don’t use the same shampoo and conditioner every time and just have several in my shower, usually using Hask brand. I use all of their scents. I have a ton of different brands but I keep going back to Hask. I cannot use a conditioner that I have a hard time brushing thorough and that brand works great for me. I use usually shampoos and conditioners that have biotin and caffeine in them with collagen."
4,B009SZXM4E,2023-10-06,Doesn't Work For Me,4.0,I started losing my hair due to a major illness I had a couple years ago. My brother who is a nephrologist told me to try this. It did not work on me but it may work on others. : )

8,B009SZXM4E,2023-12-07,One month apart photo hair update,5.0,"I started taking these in July after I chopped my hair off just past my shoulders, one a day but if I forgot then I’d take 2 or 3 a day sometimes. Decent pill size to swallow and didn’t really taste like anything. I finished my bottle in early November and am taking other biotin pills by Spring Valley just to switch it up. My hair appears thicker and seems to be grow within those 4 months, maybe very slowly. My nails are also strong too and grow pretty fast they dont bend or break as easy. Didn’t notice any difference in my skin though.
Side note: I get a trim once every 8-10 weeks because I use a lot of heat on my hair and get split dead ends, I’m in need of another soon 😅"

My hair has grown at least 8 inches over the past four months and a half usually takes less than that but I stopped for a while but I started taking them again. They don’t taste funny and I have a hard time swallowing pills, but these are great because they’re kind of on the small side. There is also the gummy alternative, which is not too bad.

41,B009SZXM4E,2023-10-25,Almost too good!,5.0,"I've been taking this biotin supplement since March. After about 6 months of use, I realized that I haven't had a cracked or split nail in months. I've had weak, peeling, breakable nails my entire life. Now my nails are so strong that they practically feel reinforced. I'm even dealing with a surprise side effect; I move a lot in my sleep and I've accidentally scratched my face a couple of times with my new, super-strong nails!"
42,B009SZXM4E,2023-10-14,Love this biotin,5.0,"I have been using nature's bounty biotin for over 8 years. I love how it makes my nails and hair grow fast. I recently reordered and received the product with a yellow-ish gel cap color. In the past, it used to be a solid white gel cap. I called the company and spoke with a representative from nature's bounty. She advised that the gel cap is now a translucent yellow . They changed it from the solid white. I was very concerned thinking that the product had spoiled in transit as the Amazon trucks can be very hot

I highly recommend taking this. Please note you will see results with consistent use."

49,B009SZXM4E,2023-08-01,The jury's still out.,4.0,"To my horror, my hair started falling out after having to take two courses of prednisone for an inflamatory condition/flare-up. I've always had LOTS of hair, but now have to do a comb-over to cover the almost-bald spots on my scalp. After finishing a full bottle of this product, I can't say there is a noticeable difference. My nails remain the same as ever, and I can't tell if there is significant hair regrowth where I need it. On the plus side, I haven't lost any more hair. Will try one more bottle of this stuff to see if it helps. If not, the next step
is minoxodil."

I'm an otherwise healthy 20 year old, so you would understand my shock when I found out I was losing chunks of my hair and there wasn't much I could do besides see my dermatologist and try some hair growth remedies. I tried biotin shampoos, didn't seem to work. I tried putting oil in my hair, too messy BUT it did make my hair sleek. I took my prescribed meds + these biotin supplements and YOU GUYS..my hair is pretty much all grown back and my nails grew so much faster and stronger! Not sure how well it works on skin since I already have clear skin, but I've read some positive things about it helping with that too. I completely recommend these supplements!! I know I'll be buying more, don't say I didn't put you on."
54,B009SZXM4E,2023-09-04,"Good Value, No Mess and No Toil for Hair Enhancement",5.0,"I was skeptical about hair enhancement products even though I had been looking for effective solutions since I am losing hair. I did not want to try spray or rub-on products because they tend to be messy and requires effort to use. Some products are also quite expensive. I decided to give these Biotin capsules a try. I have been taking them 4 times a week for 6 months now. Two results are very noticeable: some new, thin, black hair have grown, especially around my forehead, and surprisingly, in my eyebrows too; my finger and toe tails have been growing faster, so my black toenails from hiking are now replaced with healthy ones. These Biotin capsules are inexpensive and requires no effort other than opening my mouth. As long as you keep proper expectations, you will be satisfied with this product."

73,B009SZXM4E,2020-05-13,Hair is actually growing,4.0,"so for last year my son was experiencing hair thinning and even hair loss around the crown area. It was very severe and after ignoring the issue for several months with the hope it would grow back I felt I had to take matters into my own hands as I feel that it's causing him self esteem issues. My son is 16 years old. Typical teen, fairly healthy, does not eat well, has not been drinking water. We took him for his annual check-up. Doc said he was fine but if we wanted to he could go and have blood test to see if there's a thyroid issue (we still have to do this). Anyway fast forward six months. A few months ago we bought the hair max laser device and biotin gummies. He uses device sporadically even though I constantly hound him and offer to do it for him. We didn't really see much of a difference. He took gummies but again sporadic at best. So now we are under quarantine. Hubby felt we should go chemical route. I said absolutely not. He's still young and developing. I decided let's change things up a bit. Starting with his meals I am trying to introduce more biotin rich food - Typical breakfast is omelette with mushrooms and yellow bell peppers. Snack is handful of walnuts. Smoothie consisting of banana, strawberries, and handful of spinach. Several glasses of water per day. Couple of times a week I give him juice (carrots, apples and celery). Normal lunch and dinner but also trying to introduce different fruit and vegetables each day. He's actually enjoying most of the food that I've given him. I've also added these biotin pills and still hounding him to do hair max. Within one week we saw a difference. It really is a miracle but still a work in process. He forgets to drink water. He is on board with the food. He's really trying with veggies. Not a fan of juices but loves the smoothies. Not sure what has contributed to hair growth. Maybe a combo of all of this. I also wanted to massage his scalp but he won't let me. I hope this helps you. Don't give up. Definitely revamp diet."

My hair is fine, and so it tangles easily and i lose a lot of it when im showering or brushing it. Biotin and collage have seriously helped with the loss, and also my skins health. I also have a 10 step skin care routine, but the supplements have made it more even and improved the elasticity of it. I definitely recommend this product!!

82,B009SZXM4E,2023-12-10,Not sure yet,3.0,I started taking Biotin to help my nails. I haven't seen much improvement yet. I will take it a little longer and see if my nails improve at all.
83,B009SZXM4E,2022-03-14,So far so good.,4.0,"Back Story:
I'm definitely gonna be updating this when I get my hair pressed and trimmed but, the picture 📸 attached is my hair exactly 11 weeks ago before the biotin. I started this hair growth challenge against my mom and we are in a competition.

I got this dosage as a recommendation from the hair stylist that kicked off our race (Giving us our starting press &trim).
Initial Reaction:
I'm actually very pleased with the changes i have noticed so far and can't wait to see if I'll gain more benefits or hit a plateau.

The pill is super small and way easy to swallow. I'm not a fan of the smell but, it isn't strong at all. It's extremely faint. A normal person would have to stick their nose in the bottle to be able to smell it. I'm just very sensitive to smells. I have never actually tasted it (i generally keep any pills in between my teeth then swallow it down with water to avoid tasting it just in case it's an unsavory taste) so, I wouldn't be able to describe a flavor.

Now I know my hair has grown since then. My hair is not much thicker (still only been 11 weeks so we will see) but, definitely noticeably longer. Even my nails aren't as brittle and don't break off nearly as often. I know this because, I check my nails on a regular basis and will even do a bend test to check their durability.

I haven't noticed much of a difference in skin but being as though I only started taking it for hair growth. Im not really looking for a change in that department but, I'll keep taking it and see what happens.

Until Next time (typed on 03/14/2022)..."

NO!!!,5.0,"If you order this product, please note that after contacting Nature's Bounty directly, after receiving a replacement from Amazon with same color as ordered; I have been informed that the color change is because of a ""reformulation"" of the softgel. In other words, they had to make a revision to the ingredients, and that is why there was a color change. It is still the same great product it has been for many years, as well as Nature's Bounty reputation. So glad I researched this...not only for my peace of mind, but for other consumers and Amazon. Of course, this has nothing to do with Amazon as they are just the middle person. Bottles have no tamper evidence at all! Thank you Amazon and Nature's Bounty. Pls note picture with NEW COLOR"
86,B009SZXM4E,2023-04-27,Easy to swallow,5.0,"MY UPDATED REVIEW: Its now been just over 3-months since I started taking this & I am SOOO happy as 1-WEEK ago I have noticed a significant favorable change in my hair growth. Not only do I see baby hairs sprouting along my hairline but they are GRAY which proves that this product indeed works! I color my hair & haven't had to do my facial hairline because there wasn't any regrowth for at least 8-months & after showering I couldn't believe how much hair I was loosing in this area. NOW just the normal (few) amount is on the shower floor! I'm 78 y/o & my hair has always been my crowning glory, so when I started loosing it noticeably I became devastated. Don't bother with all the shampoo hair growth products until you take & give Biotin a chance. I'm taking 10k mcg daily which I checked with my doctor first for approval. NO problems, NO side effects, just good results!"
87,B009SZXM4E,2023-07-07,"Not sure of benefits claimed, but recommended by friends & doctor",4.0,"Since taking this for a couple of years I thought I had a return of some eyelashes and less hair loss post menopause. It may also be that my nails are stronger. The differences are subtle, and not as dramatic as some friends report, but better something than nothing. Tiny gel capsules, easy to swallow, no flavor."
88,B009SZXM4E,2023-09-15,the very best biotin for your body,5.0,"beautiful hair and nails are guaranteed when you take this supplement. I started taking it several years ago and now I can tell you that my hair is long and lustrous and my nails always look gorgeous long and strong without any extra effort, other than taking this pill; in my daily vitamin regimen. this brand works great. best price I've found is here on Amazon"
89,B009SZXM4E,2023-10-03,Biotin helps my Hair,5.0,I am a huge fan of biotin. I can tell a major difference in my hair and nails when I take this supplement. Overall I recommend it to anyone and everyone!
90,B009SZXM4E,2023-08-24,OMG! Hair thinning!,5.0,"Took this for years, along with a handful of complimentary vitamins, but it really didn't help to grow any hair back...except maybe on my legs and lady chin. However, it very well could have helped keep in the hair I do have. I have switched to an all-in-one vitamin, so if it don't grow on top, maybe my beard will grow long enough to style on top of my head!"
91,B009SZXM4E,2023-10-04,Works well,5.0,Been taking these every day for years. I barely lose any hair after I wash it. You Must give them time!! Eventually they kick in & I highly recommend.
92,B009SZXM4E,2023-06-05,"This works, but takes time",5.0,"My fingernails began breaking and cracking really frequently some time after I finished cancer treatment. I assume there must be some connection.

Looking at the nails before use, you could see the nails were a bit reddish with lots of grooves where cracks and breaks could develop. I ordered these. As the nails grew out, the color became more normal from the bottom up. There was still significant breaking as the bad part of the nails grew out, but you could see the healthy are drowning towards the top. The last of the bad area is currently finishing, there is less breakage, and ai can see the final result of normal healthy nails."

94,B009SZXM4E,2023-10-18,Excellent product,5.0,There was one spot where my hair was very thin. After several weeks the growth thickened.l
95,B009SZXM4E,2023-08-16,Hair Growth Magic !,5.0,My hair grows an 1/2 inch or more a month when taking this every day. I’ve taken this for years. A year ago I had a bad bleach incident and lost inches… I started taking this right after and my hair grew back long and stronger than before and it only proved that it actually works!
96,B009SZXM4E,2023-01-15,Works Great for Some People,4.0,"This supplement works great for my husband who is almost 70 and he noticed that his hair, especially eyebrows are returning to their brown color. He hasn’t noticed that his hair is any thicker (which is the primary reason we purchased this product) but he’s very happy that his gray hair seems to be darkening. I tried the supplement for about two weeks and started having stomach issues (which I later read is a side effect for some people). He has never had any stomach sensitivity so he’s going to continue using it. I noticed that the average amount of biotin is typically 1000-5000 mg so at 10,000 mags, this is definitely a mega dose. I was hoping to improve my skin and nails, so I may find one to try at a small dose that will not cause stomach upset."

102,B009SZXM4E,2024-01-14,Disappointed,1.0,I subscribed this Biotin supplement for almost 2 years. I received the latest shipment with two different color of pills in the same bottle. Although it will expire in 2025. I feel uncomfortable to take it. I am not sure why it came in two different colors with no explanation attached.

119,B009SZXM4E,2024-01-02,Product defective - Amazon won't replace or refund,1.0,"I have been taking this Nature's Bounty Biotin supplement for over 10 years and haven't had any issues with purchasing it through Amazon. This most recent purchase in late December 2023 is not the same product that I have been using. I opened the bottle and there is a foul smell to the gel caps and they are discolored. The expiration date is in 2026, so this must be a bad batch or has not been stored properly. Amazon has denied returning or replacing these and suggested I contact Nature's Bounty directly. I did that. Since these were fulfilled by Amazon Services, Nature's Bounty will not replace them either. It seems I am stuck with a bad product that I cannot use. I will no longer purchase this brand anywhere ."

142,B009SZXM4E,2023-12-07,One month apart photo hair update,5.0,"I started taking these in July after I chopped my hair off just past my shoulders, one a day but if I forgot then I’d take 2 or 3 a day sometimes. Decent pill size to swallow and didn’t really taste like anything. I finished my bottle in early November and am taking other biotin pills by Spring Valley just to switch it up. My hair appears thicker and seems to be grow within those 4 months, maybe very slowly. My nails are also strong too and grow pretty fast they dont bend or break as easy. Didn’t notice any difference in my skin though.
Side note: I get a trim once every 8-10 weeks because I use a lot of heat on my hair and get split dead ends, I’m in need of another soon 😅"

It literally makes me want to vomit to even open the bottle. I cannot and will not try to take one of these. I contacted support from Natures Bounty, and they said that was not unusual for the product, and they just said let it air out a little. Well, let me tell you, it is no where even close to usual. I would stay away from this brand if I were you."

This batch,every bottle, the capsules instead of being bright white are an off semi translucent tan color. This in itself is not a deal breaker. The capsules are fused together in the bottle. Literally fused. No amount of tapping the bottle will separate them."

However I got this bottle little over 2 months ago and just had it in my pantry and today when I go to open the new bottle they look like this. They smell bad and are all stuck together plus are discolored.I can't even return them anymore because it's past the return date. Disappointed.

172,B009SZXM4E,2023-11-05,works great,5.0,"i’ve been taking it for a couple months now and I’ve been recording my hair process. My hair has grown at least 8 inches over the past four months and a half usually takes less than that but I stopped for a while but I started taking them again. They don’t taste funny and I have a hard time swallowing pills, but these are great because they’re kind of on the small side. There is also the gummy alternative, which is not too bad. Also, it’s good for a prize to help your hair grow."

I've had weak, peeling, breakable nails my entire life. Now my nails are so strong that they practically feel reinforced. I'm even dealing with a surprise side effect; I move a lot in my sleep and I've accidentally scratched my face a couple of times with my new, super-strong nails!"

201,B000OA6Z6O,2023-04-13,"Treating my 1.5yo Cat, Ingo, w/ this for Stomatitis",5.0,"This Product is Amazing! At 10ppm (parts per million), it is on the Lower side of this Type of Product, as there are other Colloidal Silver's w/ 500ppm (& up).

However, I started giving this to my Cat, Ingo, on Monday Morning, due to him Slowly becoming Darn near Anorexic due to the Pain & Inflammation in his Mouth, causing him to Hate how Food, so he wouldn't Eat to avoid the Pain. He used to LOVE his Food & would come Running! He was a Healthy 10Lbs, but right before he got Fixed at the Beginning of March, I Weighed him to Find that he was only a Whopping 7.5Lbs! When I took him to get Neutered, I asked the Intake Staff if they could ask the Vet/Surgeon to take a Peek at his Teeth while he was Sedated & Intubated to see if they could see a Broken Tooth or Infection, etc, bc the Water Additive & PlaqueOff wasn't making the Difference I'd Hoped for. Needless to say, the couldn't be bothered to quickly take a look to let Me know what was gong on. Then Due to the Pain Meds from his Surgery he was Gorging due to not Eating enough prior to his Neuter Surgery due to the Pain, but once it wore off he slowly reverted back to treating Food like the Enemy, but the Last Straw for me was when he started Hiding more & more, acting Reclusive, not Eating & Sleeping all Day. Definitely NOT the way most Cats his Age act & I knew I had to do something. I've had Cats & Dogs my Entire Life & NEVER heard of ""Stomatitis"", which in Layman's Terms is Inflammation of the Opening of the Mouth, such as the Gums (Not the Stomach): ""Stoma"" means ""Opening of"" & -itis means ""Inflammation"". The Pain is usually SO Bad that they won't Eat or they'll Eat very little to avoid the Pain. What would happen w/ Ingo is that when his Tongue or the Food hit the Sorest Areas of his Gums he'd Puff up, Throw Himself around while Sounding like he was Hacking up Glass, but it was due to a Combo of him Hissing & trying to Remove the Food from around his Sore Gums. Other Cats are known to Drool, Growl, Paw at their Face, etc & tell tale Sign that it's Stomatitis & Not Gingivitis is the Bright Blood Red line that runs down the Gumline directly below the Teeth, but the Guns around the Teeth can also be Blood Red & Noticeably Inflamed/Swollen/Puffy.

I know that I can't Afford Dental Extractions, due to the RidiculouslyOutrageous Costs a Vet Charges, & Full Mouth Extractions is usually what a Vet's Prognosisis is for Stomatitis... ALOT of times they'll do 1/2 the Mouth, but they'll Tell Patients Parents (Dog/Cat Parents), that in Order to Treat it 100% ALL of the Teeth NEED to be Extracted, which can run into the 1000s & sometimes the Age of the Pet makes them not a Candidate for the Anesthesia that's necessary for the Surgical Extractions... & some of us Flat out can't Afford Extractions, ESPECIALLY NOT Full Mouth Extractions. So, what to do?? Let Me tell you: Colloidal Silver is a God Send. Colloidal Silver is what you need & technically should be in EVERy Household. As I mentioned above, I gave Ingo his 1st Die, w/ Gradual Increases starting at approximately 10-11a Monday Morning... It's only Wednesday Night now & already Ingo is Eating, Playing, Trilling & back to his Goofy, Loving, Hilarious Self!! If I Questioned the Power of Colloidal Silver before, I No Longer do! I'm a Believer!!

Colloidal Silver is the Equivalent of an OTC Antibiotic that can be used in People & all Animals (at least Mammals, bc I don't know enough about Reptiles & Birds to say it's Ok for them). It can be used to Treat Inflammation, Sinus Infections, Ear Infections, OBGYN Issues, Eye Infections, Sore Throats, URIs, Cuts, Acne, Bite Wounds (that are more Surface than Deep Tears which Require Stitches), it also Helps Percent Scarring, etc etc etc. I Read Testimonials of People who Suffered from Sinus Infections for Years, that used to Lay them out for Weeks, who now take this as soon as they start Feeling a Speck of a Sinus Infection Symptom & what used to be Weeks in Agony, is now a Few Crappy, but Manageable Days!!

I'd NEVER heard of Colloidal Silver until I was Desperately & Frantically Searching for Things I could do to Relieve &/or Treat Ingo's Symptoms. I was Skeptical of it Working Super Quick, but I Believed other Reviews about how Well this Worked for their Pets Stomatitis & now that I've seen it literally Work Wonders w/ my Own Eyes for Ingo in less than 3 Full Days, I'm a True Believer!

The Best Part about Colloidal Silver, besides that it Works, is that you really can't OD on it & neither can your Pet!! Just make sure you don't take Unnecessarily Excessive Amounts for a REALLY Longtime, as there's Stories of it turning people's Skin Blue Permanently. Don't let that Scare you, it takes ALOT of CS & for a LONGTIME for that to happen!!

If you're as Desperate to Help your Fur Baby, as I was to Help Ingo, you have NOTHING to Lose & EVERYTHING to Gain by Ordering this for yourself &/or your Furry Kid!! Not to mention $20 is ALOT Better than the Beginning of $1000s & a Long & Painful Recovery for your Pet. TRY THIS FIRST! IT WORKS!! I Hope you & Fur Baby Fell Better as Quickly as Ingo did!! 🐱"

218,B000OA6Z6O,2018-06-20,Sore or infected throat? This is a remedy that actually works!,5.0,"I suffer from sore throats constantly. I get strep, tonsillitis, laryngitis, and throat infections from post nasal drip, bronchitis, colds, allergies, and sinus infections. My immune system can never fight them off and I get lesions all over both tonsils and my throat and the swelling often lands me at urgent care because I become unable to swallow my own spit or breathe. Every sore throat that I have had has landed me on prescription meds and as I've gotten older, my body has become resistant to the antibiotics so my doctors have had to switch strains and increase dosages. If I try to fight it off naturally, they will persist for weeks and are so bad that I am in tears from the pain that feels like swallowing glass. I've tried every remedy known to man (any over the counter sore throat medicine, plus natural remedies like acv, herbs and spices, teas, essential oils, honey, citrus, roots, salt water, Echinacea, etc.) as I have read every blog, forum, and chatroom trying to find something that works so that I don't have to go on antibiotics and steroids. Well, this product is the one and only thing that has ever kept me from going to the doctor for a sore throat. I ordered this last week in 4oz to try as everything is in bloom down here in Tampa, FL and I had a feeling I'd be getting sick soon. Boy am I glad that I did because I woke up Monday and it was like my throat had skipped the initial two days of getting sick as there were already lesions/white pockets covering my right tonsil and the back of my throat. In its entirety, the whole back of my throat was red and swollen and upon waking, it hurt to swallow. I immediately went and grabbed the Sovereign Silver and put three full droppers under my tongue, after thirty seconds, I added three more full droppers and pushed it all to the back of my throat and swished/gargled it around for 60 seconds before swallowing. I popped some vitamins and 800mg of ibuprofen (my doc recommends this for my swelling and pain) and headed to work with the Silver in my hand. I repeated the under the tongue and back of the throat gargles then swallow throughout the day and night, so much that I had actually used half of the bottle by the time I climbed in bed. Tuesday morning, I woke up and my throat was still sore but it didn't hurt to swallow. I ran to the bathroom and holy sh*t y'all, the lesions were gone and my throat was still red but only puffy where the lesions had disappeared from. I had already taken the morning off of work and scheduled a doctors appointment because I truly did not think that this was going to work and I didn't want to suffer before surrendering to my usual concoction of prescriptions. I did the under the tongue/gargle/swallow, cancelled the doctors appointment, and headed to work with the Silver in hand again. I knew I was going to run out by the end of the day so I ordered the 8oz from here and paid $5 for same day delivery (it was delivered by 8:00pm, thanks Amazon!). I continued the same routine and finished off the bottle yesterday (Tuesday) night. Before hitting the hay, my throat was still beet red and swollen, it was sore to swallow but I wasn't in pain. Wednesday morning (today, 7 hours ago) I woke up and my throat is no longer sore or swollen but is still a bit red and I am so totally okay with that!! I cannot believe this actually worked and that it worked as quickly as it did. The only thing that has ever given me this much relief this quickly is when the Doc gives me a shot of prednisone (steroid) and the swelling in the throat goes down within the hour but that still never made the lesions go away like this does. I am in shock. I cannot believe that there isn't more information on the internet regarding this and sore throats. The only draw back for me is the cost, but I will pay any amount to keep from having infected throats. Very thankful for this, I will never let my medicine cabinet go without Sovereign Silver and I am so glad that I no longer have to frequent the doctor and taste all of the disgusting natural remedies that never work."

226,B000OA6Z6O,2015-06-19,Our household will NOT be without this natural MIRACLE in a bottle!!!,5.0,"When my son was about 8 he had a SEVERE reaction to an antibiotic after just one dose - swelling of the face and open sores that developed on his lips, the inside of his mouth and all down his throat! He couldn't eat solid food and could barely even swallow liquids for almost 2 weeks without a topical solution to numb the pain.. and the doctor's office would NOT admit this was due to the antibiotic! Internet research confirmed my reluctance to use antibiotics in the first place as well as alerted me to the possibility that it could have been a ""bad batch"" of antibiotics that caused this type of severe reaction. I'd never heard of this before nor had I been warned about the possibility of a reaction such as this. It was a truly horrifying experience that you wouldn't wish anyone to go through, especially a child! My son's lips had so many sores that at night while he slept, since his mouth was shut, they would start to scab over and his lips would actually stick together! We would have to moisten them and pull them apart which would reopen all the wounds again each morning... I would have never imagined antibiotics could cause something this horrific!

I had a choice early on, hospitalize him and put him in the hands of the ""professionals"" I was severely lacking trust in at this point.. or... a friend gave me the name of a naturopath practitioner that actually lived near me who would take an entirely different approach to healing. I went the route of the naturopath and together we helped my son recover from this incident in the comfort & security of our own home.This brilliant & caring woman introduced me to colloidal silver. From that point forward I knew my family of 4 had to take responsibility for our own health instead of blindly leaving it in the hands of others. We became proactive with our health, began eating better and instead of running to the doctor if things cropped up, we used Silver for just about everything and anything... and it worked!

My kids are now 14 & 20 and over the years we've used Silver internally and externally.. in the eyes, ears, sinuses, & throat ..for cuts, rashes, acne, bites and as a general immune booster. Usually if you catch things in the early stages, they never get a chance to turn into anything further. These days we rarely even get a cold and the flu has skipped us for many years now.

A recent health crisis was a pretty severe reaction to a spider bite on my 20 year old son's forearm that turned red and swelled to the radius of a softball which then started spreading up the inside of his arm by way of a 1/2 inch wide raised strip of redness that made it's way up to his bicep by the time he left work. This caused some alarm and he went to immediate care out of fear of the severity of the situation. They confirmed there was infection, however it hadn't entered his bloodstream so though not life threatening, the infection was in fact spreading, possibly to his lymph gland next. Despite his childhood reaction to antibiotics, that's what they prescribed telling him he could take the first dose there and wait to see what happened & at least he was ""in good hands"" should he react again. He didn't take that chance however. He left with the unfilled prescription, went home and started taking doses of Silver every 3-4 hours as well as applying it topically. Within hours the swelling had significantly reduced and the redness began to lessen, both signs the infection was already improving. By the end of the next day, it had completely healed!

Thanks to Sovereign Silver & a healthy diet containing a fair amount of fresh foods, my family is extremely healthy. My 14 year old has never had to take anything other than an occasional pain reliever his entire life and I'm SO grateful we have an alternative to harsh antibiotics and their possible side effects! I continue to be amazed at all it's many uses! Spread the word of this safe & effective alternative!!! People need to know!!!"

237,B000OA6Z6O,2022-07-11,"Give antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungi, and some viruses the big middle finger",5.0,"I've been using this product for years to treat a wide array of maladies. It kills staph, strep, and more. I've beaten sore throats, styes, stomach bugs, tooth abscesses, and even cystic acne with this product.

Someone close to me has been fighting warts on his hands for two years, and finally - after trying everything on the shelf plus actual cryotherapy to no avail - listened to me and combined an immune-boosting oral dose of this with a topical treatment of silver in gel form to the affected area. The warts disappeared in under a week.

A couple of years ago, I stepped on a wasp barefoot. The stinging, itching, and heat had me resting my foot on an ice pack under my desk at work for several days with no relief. Creams, lotions, and even anti-inflammation pain pills didn't work to treat it. I finally soaked some gauze in this silver, applied to my foot, and wrapped it up before bed. The NEXT MORNING, the venom had been drawn out, and the swelling and heat were reduced to practically nothing, gone completely by the end of the day.

I'm not saying this is a cure-all for literally everything on the planet. I'm not saying it's magical. What I am saying is that it's incredibly versatile, and I always use it as a first defense before resorting to antibiotics. Why? Because of the mechanics by which silver attacks and neutralizes bacteria, there's no way for it to form a resistance. It'd be like you evolving the ability to survive decapitation. It ain't happening.

It's also safe, natural, and non-toxic. Heck, I've cleared my cat of a UTI by adding an adjusted dose to her water. I've healed an infected wound on my dog by applying topically and wrapping, with no worries as to what might happen if the bandage falls off and he licks up the silver.

This particular brand of silver is my trusted go-to because of the high ppm concentration, and the quality glass bottle that keeps the suspension from breaking down over a longer period of time than a plastic one can.

Do yourself a favor: do your research on applicable uses for this product (again, it's *ridiculously* versatile, but there's no such thing as a cure-all), and make it the front-runner of your medicine cabinet."
238,B000OA6Z6O,2023-02-09,"Maybe it works, not really sure",5.0,"Alright folks, let's talk about this ""Silver Bullet"" they call Bio-Active Silver for the immune system. I mean, I get it, who wouldn't want a product that promises to boost your immunity and protect you from all the germs and nasties out there, right? So, I took the plunge and tried it out for a few weeks, hoping for a superhero-like transformation. But here's the truth, I didn't notice any major changes, to be honest. But that doesn't mean this product is a bust.

First off, the packaging is pretty snazzy, with a little bottle that looks like it could cure all your problems with just one spritz. The liquid inside is fairly unassuming, and all-in-all it looks like something you'd find in an old-timey apothecary. It's pretty cool to look at, but whether or not it actually helps your immune system, I can't say for sure.

Now, the taste, oh boy. It's not the greatest. But, I mean, if you're looking for a product that tastes like candy and gives you superpowers, you're probably in the wrong place. It's a bit like drinking liquid metal, and I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. But hey, it's not like I'm drinking it for the taste, I'm drinking it for the benefits, right?

So, did I notice a major improvement in my immunity after taking Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol? No, not really. But, I have to say, the product seems alright. It's not a complete game-changer, but it's not like it did me any harm either. If you're looking for a little extra support for your immune system, it might be worth giving it a try. And hey, who knows, maybe you'll have better luck than I did and turn into a germ-fighting machine."

242,B000OA6Z6O,2019-09-06,"Best, Natural antibiotic solution",5.0,"I developed a Urinary tract infection and I gotten them periodically throughout my life, I’m 52 years old now. I had my first one in my early 20’s. I have also had several cases of Pink eye since I was 6 years old, last case of Pink Eye was about 2 years ago. I also suffered from occasional severe sinus infections throughout my life too. Colloidal Silver once I read about it and started using it, has worked better than any antibiotic a Doctor prescribed for me, with no side effects. Colloidal Silver can take a little longer to cure an infection depending on how long you waited to treat it and how severe of an infection you have but I personally prefer natural with no side effects than manufactured, with negative side effects. I take the prescribed on the bottle amount internally and then drop 2 to 3 drops in each eye throughout the day to cure Pink Eye. Sinus infection, take prescribed amount internally and then clean my hands and put a dropper full into one hand, close one nostril and then snort the Colloidal Silver this way, up each nostril, several times a day until the sinus infection is gone. I do the same when I get an I.U.D. & then I place a cotton ball with Colloidal Silver all over it and place that over my Urethal opening, overnight & I start to feel better the next day and I keep doing this until the burning sensation stops on my Urethal opening and the urgency to pee subsides back down to normal and there is no more pain when I urinate or in my bladder. I am not a Doctor,I can only tell you my personal stories of success through trial and error of what worked for me in regards to using Colloidal Silver. Everybody’s genetics, chemical makeup, physical bodies are different and what works for me may be different than what works for you. Use the methods that work best for you, including going to a Doctor and purchasing a pharmaceutical drug, antibiotic that works for you.Sovereign Silver does appear to work faster and better than other forms of Colloidal Silver in my opinion and through all of the different types I have tried over the years. I love the way this was packaged and sent to me. One bigger sized cardboard box with a little bit of a smaller cardboard box within it & then a black, medium density, slightly, malleable plastic/rubber mix, cap on each end of the thinner, cardboard box that contained the Colloidal Silver bottle, along with a couple of clear, plastic, air filled bubbles on each side of box that held the bottle. I have Prime Amazon and my package arrive on the date they told me it would, which was the next day and product arrive completely intact and unbroken.

I can admit it, I used this as a Hail Mary on a 9 week old kitten's infected eye and now I'm so glad that I did! The eye hadn't been responding to Terramycin and was so swollen and bulging that I was scared to even give her her oral antibiotics for fear that the stress of it would increase the pressure in the eye too much and it would rupture. I started the night this was delivered with two drops, repeating every 4h. In 24h the swelling was significantly diminished. I lowered the dosage to 2 drops every 6h for the next 72 hrs, when the eye opened, then 2 drops every 8h for the following 3 days. Terramycin was still administered 3x/d. On day 7, there was a clear, healthy eye, with no sign of any trauma or disease. I continued dosing 1 drop every 12h for another week to be sure. She went from an oozing, super infected, completely compromised eye that was ready to rupture at any moment to a PERFECTLY HEALED EYE that showed no sign that there had EVER been anything wrong with it. In SEVEN DAYS. If that's not a miracle, I don't know what is..."
247,B000OA6Z6O,2023-05-30,Kills Parvovirus in dogs in 24 hours!!!!,5.0,"This product is a must have in your medicine cabinet. I’ve cured two dogs in the last 5 years that caught Parvovirus.

My 3 year old American Bully started having uncontrollable bloody diarrhea and constant vomiting. He soon was very unstable and was borderline paralyzed from lack of energy. My local veterinary hospital wanted $200 emergency visit fee plus any medications or procedures that were not even guaranteed to work. I’m on a broken fixed income and live month to month. I didn’t have $200 plus any added fees for a veterinarian. I knew Sovereign Silver worked before and so I drove an hour away to find a bottle. Administered a teaspoon via dropper every hour for the next 8 hours to my pup. This Silver was the first liquid he was able to hold down. All night long I kept giving him this silver. The next morning he was able to walk. He still had diarrhea, but it wasn’t bloody. Later that same day his diarrhea stopped. He began eating solid foods again. His eyes were bright again. Even his coat was shining again. This is truly a miracle liquid. I Highly Recommend this product. I’m not a doctor or veterinarian and cannot give medical advice. I’m only relaying what I know worked for me."

He sites the FDA which the FDA is in bed with big Pharma and that’s the only reason they are dismissing colloidal silver. I take orally when I feel like I’m getting sick I gargle with it when I’m getting a sore throat I use it for any type of skin infection I have used it in my cats eyes with success better than any prescription the doctor or I should say a vet would prescribe. My granddaughter cleared up Pink EYE with colloidal silver and her doctor praised her mother for using a natural product. My son used it for cellulitis when the antibiotic couldn’t finish the Collodial silver did, he used it orally and topically. This brand may be expensive this is the one I have used for over 22 years and I believe it is the best. What I recommend to people start out slow you use common sense you’re not gonna drink the stuff. For example if I’m sick I might take a tablespoon four or five times a day. And I’m sure you can take more but it seems to work for me I use it like a regular antibiotic you take at intervals. So if what you’re reading online or reviews like the one that cited the FDA, ignore it and try it I wouldn’t be without it ever."

253,B000OA6Z6O,2017-07-01,SAVE A FORTUNE IN VETERINARY & DOCTOR BILLS...and more.,5.0,"5 STARS!!! I was told about this product years before I tried it. Don't do what I did!!
I have used this product for my pets when they have been hurt. I gave them 1ml or 1cc at a time. It begins to work very quickly!!! It stops bleeding quickly!!! It has prevented them from getting the serious infection that they normally would have gotten from their wounds. One of my Jack Russells had a horrible large puncture wound on the back of his neck. ( I have NO IDEA how he got hurt this way) He hated for anyone to touch him when he was hurt. The only thing I did for this large puncture wound was to give him 1cc or 1ml of Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Hydrosol , using a NEEDLELESS allergy size syringe or insulin size syringe orally 4 to six times a day. He readily accepted it. It tastes like pure water. This wound completely healed from the inside out. I have saved a fortune in vet bills treating my own pets this way.
It works equally well on humans! I use the nasal sprayer on myself to treat and prevent sinusitis and sinus infections. I have not had another infection since I began doing this for myself. I use it for burns, insect bites, sore throat, cuts, toenails and fingernails when they need it. I used it when I had SHINGLES on my face!! I never got the normally seen secondary infection. Everytime my face burned or itched I took a teaspoon ( 5ml or 5cc ) of the Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol. It worked!!! Their recommended dosing is accurate!! It is hard to believe, at first, that only a teaspoon at a time is really going to help.
For me... just a spray or two at a time in my mouth or nose has also really helped. Now I do only that much a day to ward off whatever I may have come into contact with.
It gives me peace of mind with all you can get from a tick bite that you never see, mosquito bites, super-bugs & flesh eating Strep-A that is everywhere!
But that is just me.
Try it for yourself, your family and your pets.
Still, go to your doctor when you need to.
I keep a 32 oz bottle at all times. It costs much less to use it that way. It is a very inexpensive & highly effective product to use.

254,B000OA6Z6O,2023-03-20,Honestly can’t tell if it’s working ‼️UPDATED,3.0,"First let me say that this is not the first time I have used this product. Every time I do get it, the dropper does not fill up, as shown in my pic. It never works. This is literally like water. I feel like the first time I used this it might’ve helped me get over a toothache and cold. I could be wrong though and it could just be coincidence. But, I suffer from random rash breakouts and joint pains (currently getting tested for autoimmune diseases) and every time I have put this on an itchy spot, it stops the itch. I thought it was all in my head and that I just convinced myself it was working but it really did help. Multiple times. So for that, and for really feeling that it helped with the toothache, I give it 4 stars. I’m going to continue using and see if anything changes.

‼️UPDATE ‼️

I stand by what I say about it helping with itchiness HOWEVER, it for sure does not help with colds or sickness, in my case. Had a consistent harsh cough, lost my sense of taste and smell, and had food poisoning in a separate occasion. It did nothing for neither issue and I remained the same, even after drinking the max amount per day. It didn’t help at all. For this, 3 stars, because what is it really good for then?"

262,B000OA6Z6O,2018-08-22,AMAZING PRODUCT! TREATED PUPPY STRANGLES!,5.0,"My 4 week old mini dachshund mix puppy was disgnosed with puppy strangles (juvenile cellulitis) just 4 days after we adopted her. This disorder is aggressive & began to take over her little body with oozing abscess sores & swelling of her lymph nodes. She started on antibiotics & steroids but those weren’t seeming to help very much; even after her being on them for 3 weeks. Everyday I would come home to multiple abscesses & sores ranging from pea size to quarter size that would open & drain puss/blood. I couldn’t keep track of how many holes she had on her little head, face, ears, neck & body, & also had puss-like fluid sitting in her ear canals. Her poor head was literally filled with puss & was oozing everywhere. I was desperate for something I could try that wouldn’t interfere with her prescribed meds. Within 7 days of adding this supplement to her cocktail of medicine (cephalexin every 8 hours & steroids every 24 hours) & also spraying it on her sores, I saw a huge turn around. I have now began the taper process off the steroids & her antibiotics expired. We are just 2 days shy of using this for 2 weeks & she is almost 100% healed. I recommend this supplement 1000%. Anyone & everyone with pets that ever get cuts or any type of skin issue should know about this product. It needs to be on the shelves of every single vet office!"
263,B000OA6Z6O,2023-02-23,I purchased this for BV,4.0,A friend of mine used this to assist with clearing BV and it worked for her. I was a little afraid it might burn my coco so I didn't add the same measurements that she did but it seems to have helped with only 3 days of use. I would have to go back to the doctor to be absolutely sure that it's not present. I would not advise anyone to order this for this purpose as I was instructed by some I know on correct measurements and exactly how to insert it. IM NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. I will hold on to the rest of it for any future problem that may occur that might warrant me to have to use this for its general purpose.
264,B000OA6Z6O,2021-11-06,Life saver for wound care,5.0,"This has saved & extended my mom's life, I'm sure, by preventing infection in wounds for years. Wounds that don't heal quickly like ulcers need to be continually protected from bacteria. Antibiotics can't be taken long term due to bacteria developing resistance and health problems coming from continual decimation of the positive internal bacteria (probiotics) that bodies need. Enter silver! It's an element that kills bacteria on contact (iodine is another one), so spraying it on a surface will kill bacteria where it's sprayed. (By the way, I've been told we shouldn't use silver and iodine together -- they can form compounds that can cancel out each other's benefit or something.) This product offers just silver (the element, Ag) suspended as tiny particles in water (which is definition of ""colloidal""). The tiny size of particles means it can reach into and touch more surfaces and interact better (I'm unclear of mechanisms here) and hence have better killing power than larger particles. In large enough quantities, silver is toxic to humans, but in small volumes (e.g. a few sprays daily for years), I don't think it causes any harm to human cells. It also can be applied to the surface of skin, so it doesn't have to go to the gut to affect our GI tract bacteria. Highly recommend using this. It's odorless and painfree, and doesn't stain, feels like spraying on water. Silver been used in wars and other areas of the world where drugs are in short supply for a very long time to prevent and clear up infections."
265,B000OA6Z6O,2023-06-28,Effective product,4.0,I live in central cali and air quality is bad here my cat gets lots of allergies and her eyes always watering and sneezing. Since I used this product on her eyes she is doing an amazing.
266,B000OA6Z6O,2018-05-28,Good for whatever ails you,5.0,"On my doctor's recommendation, I started using Severin Silver about 15 years ago for a variety of reasons.
- Initially I took it to shorten the duration of weekly herpes outbreaks (Ewww.). I take it orally and put the gel right on the herpes sore. If I'm consistent in taking it every day, however (about 1 teaspoon twice a day,) I don't even get an outbreak. But alas, I'm human and do forget. I double the dosage (about a tbsp every 2-3 hours during an outbreak) and it shortens the healing from a week to 2-3 days.
- Ditto for colds, infections, skin sores and plugged nasal passages.
- The biggest help, however, is using SS for Epstein Barr Virus. If I use it every day I keep the virus in abeyance (1-2 tsps /day.) If I forget to take it, symptoms come on after a couple of days of abstainence, but go away quickly when I start the dosage again.
- The biggest surprise was using it on impulse to get rid of a huge wart on my leg. Ewww again. I tried several other remedies to shrink it, to no avail. Then I put some of the SS gel on a cotton facial cleanser pad and taped it over the wart. I changed the ""bandage"" after every shower (daily.) I saw a difference after the second day. While it took about three weeks, I saw an improvement every time I changed the bandage. The wart, or whatever it was completely gone in 3-4 weeks and has sprouted back up for over 6 months.
- And lastly, I tried it on a few skin tags and it work on them as well. Just amazing.
I really love this stuff and particularly the Sovereign brand. Like someone else's review, I'd give it 10 stars too."

268,B000OA6Z6O,2018-02-23,I can't live without this!!,5.0,"After buying dozens of products for a myriad of health issues, I finally realized this is the ONLY product I need. Having been forced to take a steroid prescription, I was left with all sorts of fungal problems....itchy skin, perioral dermatitis, then something that
made me look like my face had chicken pox -- these painful little cyst-like bumps with goo inside each spot. I know what doctors
do...they prescribe cortisone for skin problems and I know this was fungal, caused by the original steroid prescription, so I then bought one topical anti fungal soap, cream, lotion, shampoo....after another, to no avail. I then thought I was getting a UTI so I
took this silver fora few days and voila, it was gone.......Of course, I got a lowered immunity from having been prescribed steroids...Now I took the silver orally because I was having to kill yeast/fungus/candida and boost my immune system. For so long, I was at my wits end. My savior was this one product....Soverign Silver....I first started taking a few drops per day and went up to dropperfuls...washing my face, then putting the silver on my face with a cotton ball, letting it dry...Adding some silver to my shampoo, to my conditioner, to my skin creams....Everything I did every day was including this silver product...Internally, topically....and then I started seeing results... very slowly....a few weeks...but I started making great progress....This is a product with miraculous results....Everyone needs at least one bottle in their house....for bug bites, cuts, burns, even things that appear on the skin or present as viruses....a sore throat, a stuffy nose....itchy eyes. I've used this silver for so many different issues. I've squirted the silver into my eyes when they were burning....(likely due to this chronic fungal
condition) and it felt soothing. There are probably thousands of conditions where this silver is better than everything else....
better than prescriptions, natural products and products designed for maybe just fungus....those anti fungal shampoos which leave
hair dry, or oily and in many cases don't work. If something is going on outside of the body, it likely needs help inside the body....
kill the ""bugs""....(and then think of replacing good bacteria with some probiotics). Honestly, I've been itching and looking at my
terrible skin for months...It's slowly starting to heal...I credit this silver product to my healing....taking it orally and putting it on my
skin. It's my miracle in a bottle!"

277,B000OA6Z6O,2015-04-17,Amazing!!,5.0,"My 7-year-old dog developed some sort of growth on the temporal corner of his right eye in October 2014. It didn't look like a tumor and it wasn't bothering him, so I decided to just watch it. The growth was about 1/4"" long when about half of it fell off in late November. I still kept an eye on it, hoping it would just fall off on its own without veterinary intervention. However, it grew to about 1/2"" long by March 2015, and for some reason, the base of it started bleeding one night. Next morning, I immediately made a vet appointment for 3 days later. Meanwhile, I thought I'd just TRY doing something, just to stop the bleeding. I already had a 2 oz. bottle of Sovereign Silver in the house, so I sprayed some on a cotton ball and dabbed the area. A day later, I noticed nearly a half of the growth was gone. I initially thought it might have fallen off because of the bleeding or something, so I just continued dabbing with Sovereign Silver. Next day, MOST of it was gone. There was a tiny, tiny little bit of the ""base"" left, and that's all we had left to show the vet (I had to show him pictures to prove that something WAS there). The vet didn't know what the cause was, and wanted to do surgery to completely remove it and do some testing, but I decided to think about it since colloidal silver seemed to be doing something. So I continued to dab the area of the growth 2-3 times a day, and guess what? It looks as if nothing ever happened. I also used it on my dog's hot spots in the past. Sovereign Silver is definitely a keeper! I'll continue to buy it as long as they keep making it.

Now, before some of you go on judging me about how we never figured out why exactly my dog got the growth in the first place, I had about $330 worth of blood work and testing done, and everything was great. Also, the growth was definitely NOT a tumor, so I'm not claiming that colloidal silver removed my dog's eye tumor."
278,B000OA6Z6O,2021-04-21,Colloidal river may be of value in chronic nasal infection,5.0,"I am NOT using colloidal silver as a tonic. I believe that is pseudo-science.
But I am interested in its use for chronic sinus infections. I used colloidal silver for sinus infection in childhood, during the 1940s, before the antibiotic era.
Many people suffer from persistent or recurrent sinus infections that become resistant to antibiotics. The are research papers, which indicate that colloidal silver may be of some value in treating these conditions. The antibiotic resistance is attributed to the formation od a ""biofilm"" by the bacteria. The term describes the ability of some bacteria to form a protected environment, which prevents an effective level of antibiotic from inhibiting their growth or killing them. Dental plaque is an example of a biofilm.
In vitro studies (in culture medium-not in the body) have demonstrated that that colloidal silver does not penetrate the cell wall, but affects the external environment of the bacteria, stopping their growth. A colloidal silver atom has a positive charge, which causes it to be attracted to the cell wall of bacteria, according to research studies.
While colloidal silver is easily sprayed into the nose, or introduced into the nasal passages with cotton tipped applicators, it is uncertain whether such methods can deliver an effective concentration of colloidal silver to the interior of the sinus cavities, where the infection is.
I am seeing some positive results in my own condition, but whether or not, it will result in a cure, remains to be seen."

My 11-year-old female Khaki Campbell (duck) was suffering from reproductive ailments for years, and the vet did not know how to help her. I read about colloidal silver and decided to give it a try. Within weeks, ""Libby"" began acting like her old self again, and when the vet examined her, he could not find any lumps, growths, or eggs in her abdomen. The vet was amazed and told me to continue treating Libby with the colloidal silver. I just bought a giant-sized bottle of this stuff, and I am going to keep Libby on it indefinitely. Highly recommended!"
282,B000OA6Z6O,2022-03-23,Works SO WELL,5.0,"Everytime we start to feel under the weather we take this stuff and our sickness is gone!

My baby even had congestion he couldn't get over for weeks. I thought maybe it was me consuming to much dairy again and I needed to cut back (as that occurred when he was a newborn and removing dairy from my diet fixed his congestion issues he had as a result of nursing) but it didn't seem to make a difference. I decided it must be a small virus he couldn't kick so I tried a small amount of silver and the next day his congestion was gone. I didn't want to give him to much so I waited but that night it started coming back so I gave him two more doses over the next 24 hours and again the congestion disappeared. After WEEKS of having to use the nose Frida multiple times a day and his poor little cough getting worse and worse I couldn't believe he got better so quickly.

I got this in case we got sick with the Big C to help our symtoms but I'm glad I've had it on hand for other things. We've been lucky enough to stay well the past few months and I attribute that to having silver as needed."

286,B000OA6Z6O,2019-07-20,Sovereign Silver Is FANTASTIC!,5.0,"Sovereign Silver Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol is AH-MAZING!!! I absolutely ♥️ LOVE ♥️ it, have purchased it several times (in increasingly larger bottles, LOL 😉) and use it for a plethora of things. After doing significant research re: colloidal silver, I purchased this specific brand ""Sovereign Silver"" here on Amazon. (I'm a middle school teacher, I research EVERYTHING. It's just who I am...I can't make a purchase without doing research. Drives some of my friends and family *crazy*...oh well!)

The bottle states, ""Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol - Immune Support""...but it can be used MYRIAD different ways, including topically to put on cuts/scrapes...I have/do use it on my multiple ear/facial piercings if they start to feel achy or sore. In a day or two, all better! I also put drops of it into my dogs' water bowl [it is clear, odorless and tasteless] because it helps with their teeth cleanliness *and* it REALLY freshens their breath...MUCH better than any of the ""dog breath fresheners"" on the market. (How do I know this, you ask? The answer is that I've tried all of them (or *at least* 35-40 of them, LOL!)

I adore my dogs (both rescues) but as they've aged, their oral hygiene has become more difficult to manage. My chihuahua is now 18 years old, has become almost completely deaf, and has the stinkiest breath you can imagine! 🐶😆 However, I love him BIG ♥️ and would try ANYTHING to make him happy, comfortable and healthy. Adding a few drops of Sovereign Silver to his water every day is such an easy way to keep his teeth/gums healthy AND to freshen his breath...I don't have to struggle to get a canine toothbrush/toothpaste into his tiny mouth (something he HATES) *and* something that really never fully addressed the ""bad breath"" issue.

If you are looking for colloidal silver, I highly recommend purchasing this particular brand, ""Sovereign Silver."" You won't be disappointed!"
287,B000OA6Z6O,2021-08-06,MY SEVERE ALLERGIES are GONE in TWO DAYS!!!,5.0,"Five days ago, I bought Colloidal Silver to splash on my face as I did micro needling & a bit of fibroblast as recommended by the wonderful TJ Tutorials on youtube. I didn't realize the one I bought was 10ppm and that there are different strengths. I read the positive reviews on how it cures allergies. Well, I have 365 days allergy; my sinus won't stop from running, eyes itching if I don't take Allegra. I take double 24 hours Allegra every morning and Benadryl before I go to sleep. That doesn't include the TWO years of allergy injection once a week! I take AC vinegar to neutralize all these meds and get them out of my body every day. I started taking it 5 days ago, and I noticed the following day, my nose was all dry! No runny nose! I stopped taking the Allegra, and yesterday I stopped the Benadryl as well. I can't believe it! OMG, I am healed. NO runny nose, no itchy eyes even around the cats! So, I increased the dosage to this 500ppm. If the 10ppm healed me in two days, what more with this?"

290,B000OA6Z6O,2014-12-01,Miraculous Results,5.0,"I cannot say enough about this product. My daughter brought it to my attention when I developed a skin rash that ran over 1/2 of my body within 24 hours. It was so itchy. Even Rx steriod creams didn't help. I was miserable. She brought me a bottle of this product and I applied it all over. Within minutes the itch was relieved and within 24 hours (more applications every few hours) there was significant healing . It has been about 10 days (and I ordered this bottle as I was getting low on the bottle she brought me) and I am continuing to heal. Rash is just about gone. I should say that I combined this with Vetiver essential oil which is supposed to have healing properties for rashes as well. Between the 2 products I have had very good response.

I have also been taking it internally as recommended on the label.

I also have a dog who has an eye infection. I was giving her Terramycin eye ointment for her infection and it wasn't getting better. So I tried this and overnight I saw significant improvement. At this rate I'm thinking she will be free of infection within a couple of days.

I will not be without this product in my first aid cabinet, ever.

My granddaughter had an outbreak of pimples (no doubt monthly hormones were the cause) and we put this on her outbreak. She uses Pro-active which is very helpful, but this product worked to heal within 2 days.

While waiting for this order I shopped at the local vitamin store and while looking at collodial silver products I asked the ownr if the 30 PPM product would be better than this one which is 10PPM. He said no because this product has the smallest molecular structure which make it more readily deposited in the body (not his exact words, but something to that effect). So stick with this product."

I recently had been unsuccessfully trying to heal a nasty allergic reaction that turned infected and then into a lingering skin inflammation. To this day, I don't know how I could have forgotten about the two powerhouse healers, Colloidal Silver, as well as Aloe Vera. As soon as I applied a high quality liquified form of Aloe Vera (being able to deeply penetrate skin layers), as well as the amazing ""SOVEREIGN SILVER FIRST AID TOPICAL HEALING GEL"", my poor and by then confused and over irritated skin said ""ahhh, finally"" and turned the corner into the direction of improvement and regeneration. Our body speaks to us, all we have to do is learn how to listen.
I am currently using, and shall continue to do so on a daily basis, the Sovereign Silver Colloidal Silver, internally for immune system maintenance as well as sprayed on my skin whenever there is any irritation, and their *****First Aid Gel***** is from now on a staple in my medicine cabinet. I highly recommend Colloidal Silver and the SOVEREIGN SILVER brand in particular, as this company has proven their product excellence for many years."
292,B000OA6Z6O,2023-08-01,Great!,5.0,"Great stuff, don't want to narrow benefits down to my use but it my needs. Probably beneficial to our health on many levels."
293,B000OA6Z6O,2023-08-07,Very happy!!,5.0,I have bought this product several times . It is a staple product in my household. I not only use it for myself but I give to my furbabies also when needed.
294,B000OA6Z6O,2020-04-28,THIS WORKS!!!,5.0,"I have a boxer pup that has Puppy Pyoderma (Staphylococcus bacteria) all over her body. She had it when I got her and it just got worse and worse. I spent quite a bit of money at the vets, for antibiotics and shampoos. These only held the problem at bay. My poor pup would itch and scratch herself all the time. She had small pus filled bumps all over her body and legs, she was missing hair and had red raw skin. I did not want to continue to have her on antibiotics and give her more problems. I found this Silver product searching for a more natural cure for her bacteria infection, and read the reviews. I decided why not try it. I am so pleased with the results so far. With in 3 days I started seeing less bumps on her body everywhere, and it just keeps getting better. She has had this infection for about 6 months, it was what they call a deep infection, so it had a strong hold on her body. She has been on the Silver for 1 week now, and almost all her bumps are gone. She has some still on her legs, but they are slowly going away. She looks like a normal healthy young dog now, not like she got into a hornets nest. I will be using this Silver for my dogs and for myself and family. It can help with many things from what I have read about it. If you have doubts buy a small bottle. You might be glad you tried it, I am so glad I did. IT WORKS!"

298,B000OA6Z6O,2021-11-03,Acne Holy Grail,5.0,"I’m allergic to palm, coconut and witch hazel and ALL of the derivatives… which are in everything cosmetic: moisturizers, toners, lotions, hand soap, toothpaste, mouth wash, shampoos, conditioners, and even toilet paper. They’re also in most foods… which is super fun because my main symptoms after I’ve accidentally ingested the tiniest molecule… is cystic acne. I have learned enough to stay away, but I can’t clean my oil skin with anything except water, which leads to more acne. It’s been a super fun cycle.

Enter this. Someone in my coconut allergy group on FB said she cleaned her skin with it and it cleared up her face. I already had this bottle on hand and had forgotten about it, so I gave it a shot. My face finally cleared up after 2 days of use, but I noticed a difference the next morning after only one use. Someone it controls my oil production, so I wipe my face with water on a cloth, then fab this all over. My scars are fading faster too.

New holy grail for acne care and I won’t be without it."

After trying EVERYTHING I realized that i have ALLERGIES and that is what my flare up was.

336,B000OA6Z6O,2023-12-02,Product seems fine. Cannot tell is it has helped though.,4.0,Hard to say this product is effective althought I know silver is very beneficial in stimulating the immune system. The taste is like water but thicker. Glass bottle so that is good. But who knows. Hard to rate. I would say neutral at this point. Will see if I purchase a second bottle.

344,B000OA6Z6O,2023-11-22,Does not have absorption,1.0,"After researching this product against colloidal silver(which should ALWAYS be an amber color), the only information I found was the Sovereign Silver(supplier) website or other websites linked to them. I didn't realize this at the time so I ordered this product. After receiving this I noticed this is a completely different product than colloidal silver and a clear color. I dug up a medical research on colloidal and silver hydrosol and the colorless counterparts had no absorption in the body. Colloidal Silver which is the amber color always, has been used since the 1800's and researched well. Hydrosol, even if it's 'bio active' has no benefits on the body because the body cannot absorb it. I recommend MesoSilver, Silver Wings and Coated Silver brands after looking into this. As far as the PPM for you, you'll have to do your own research!"
345,B000OA6Z6O,2023-11-20,Poor,2.0,I disliked the fact that the dropper would not fill. Maybe filled up 1/4 th the way. I couldn’t tell it was doing anything toward fighting infection

There is NO scientific or clinical evidence whatsoever that ingesting colloidal silver solution orally can benefit your health. Silver has no known functions or benefits to the human body when taken by mouth, and it is not an essential mineral. In fact taking silver solution in the long run can have serious side effects, it can permanently turn your skin into a bluish tint and can also damage your kidneys and liver, and can alter brain function.

Taken with antibiotics actually helps synergize the effects. But you can't trust hippie holistic-care cause they haven't figured out an effective regimen for 500 ppm vs 10,000 pm for specific illnesses. Lesson learned!"

Use it daily it is amazing"
401,B07S38C5WW,2023-12-28,Works like a charm!,5.0,I have tried many other brands and always come back to this one! Dissolve under tongue and feel sleepy around 25 minutes later. Tastes fine and I highly recommend. Side note… have had occasions where I needed to change course and stay awake and was able to push through without a ton of drowsiness. Conclusion when you start to feel sleepy shut it down and let it do its job.
402,B07S38C5WW,2023-12-02,"Safe, Easy, Effective",5.0,"The strawberry flavor, fast dissolving tablet is ideal for me. As a senior, it's vital that any sleep aid does not have side effects, as prescription meds may, that would put me at risk of falling when I need to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night."
403,B07S38C5WW,2022-08-28,Best Taste and Better than ANY Narcotic if 20+ years!,5.0,"Do NOT buy the 10mg the taste is bitter from I love the taste of this brand Natrol melatonin berry flavored! I love the fact that it dissolves in my mouth and taste like candy :-) it’s fast acting usually within 15 to 30 minutes max I am ready to pass out. And that’s coming from somebody who has a sleep deficiency where I only cycle 2 to 3 times if I’m lucky or is not as people say for 8 to 12 times. Which means I am never arrested! Plus on top of that I’ve had insomnia since I was a newborn I’m not even joking my mom take me to the hospital as a baby because I would not fall asleep until the sun came up and then slept until 11 AM every day. She was so delirious she actually believed my doctors joke that I was a vampire! I have tried every narcotic out there you name it I’ve taken it. Majority of our ties me to sleepwalk, some of them are causing me to sleep drive, some of them or hola me to wake up in the morning and I have been fired twice because of Ambien. Although that was early in my 20s. However this product is amazing! I do NOT recommend the 10 mg ones, it has a better taste because melatonin isn’t exactly that great tasting but the berry flavor covers that all up with the 5 mg and taste like a sweet treat right before bed! And has even improve the quality of my sleep, rather than waking feeling as if I’ve gotten no sleep, my recent sleep study shows that I am cycling now twice as many times as before and all that so I’m not in the normal range it is getting better. I feel I owe it all to Natto!!"
404,B07S38C5WW,2023-12-11,Best Melatonin I've tried!,5.0,"I've been taking these dissolvable melatonin tablets for about a year now and I love them! They dissolve fast and taste great. I usually take one about an hour before bedtime, and sleep so much better than I used to. I was a very restless sleeper that would sometimes take hours to fall asleep, but thanks to melatonin I fall asleep easily and get a good restful night's sleep. My one small issue with them is that I wake up a little groggier than usual, but I can usually shake that off after a few minutes."
405,B07S38C5WW,2024-01-12,Works great!,5.0,"I have a hard time sleeping so I take these pretty regularly. This was my second bottle. For me, it takes a while to kick in so I have to plan ahead and take it so I can be tired at the time I want to go to sleep. Its a good value and the tablets dissolve fast."
406,B07S38C5WW,2023-08-23,Works well,4.0,"I had clinical insomnia last fall and winter. My doctor recommended I use REMFresh. I tried it and it worked really well. However, the price skyrocketed to $75 and more.
The reviews for this melatonin product were very promising, but I am a skeptic….
I am very happy with this product. I don’t sleep quite as deep as I did with the other, but I do return to a comfortable sleep easily when I have to get up during the night. Fortunately, it doesn’t leave me thick headed in the morning.
I would highly recommend this product. Monetarily there’s no contest. Effectiveness is wonderful.
I hope you get great results, too."
407,B07S38C5WW,2023-12-25,Best sleep ever,5.0,"I slept like a baby. Great taste, they dissolve in your mouth so no swallowing pills. Brings a lot of them for the price!! Worth it!"
408,B07S38C5WW,2024-01-10,Natrol Melatonin 5mg: A Five-Star Sleep Upgrade That Surpasses Expectations,5.0,"Having been a loyal user of the NOW melatonin brand for over a decade, I was hesitant to switch, but trying Natrol Melatonin 5mg has been a revelation, earning it a well-deserved five-star rating.

From the first night, I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of my sleep – a peaceful and restful experience that I hadn't realized was missing. Initially skeptical, I attributed it to a possible fluke, but after consistently using Natrol Melatonin for two bottles now, I can confidently say it's no accident.

The effectiveness of Natrol Melatonin is consistent and reliable, making it an essential part of my nighttime routine. The transition from my previous brand has been seamless, and the positive impact on my sleep has been undeniable.

I wholeheartedly recommend the Natrol Melatonin 5mg to anyone seeking a reliable and effective sleep aid. It has surpassed my expectations, providing the serene and restorative sleep I've been longing for. In my book, it's a five-star game-changer!"
409,B07S38C5WW,2023-12-02,Works and yummy,5.0,I break this in half and is all that I need whenever I can’t fall asleep. Sometimes I give like 1.25mg of it to my kids when they won’t sleep either and works like a charm. I didn’t have any side effects like headache etc as they said about taking melatonin.. this is the first I ever took this supplement and The first night I had half of the tablet it worked immediately.
410,B07S38C5WW,2023-11-29,Sweet Dreams in a Flash,5.0,"My go-to solution for fast and efficient sleep aid. The quick-dissolve feature lives up to its name, providing a swift and effective way to prepare for a restful night. One of the standout features for me is the strawberry flavor. It is pleasant for adults, but it's also for kids. The enjoyable taste eliminates the struggle of convincing little ones to take it, turning bedtime into a smoother and more enjoyable routine.
."
411,B07S38C5WW,2024-01-04,better than others,5.0,"I originally purchased these because I wanted a dissolving pill that did not contain red-40 in the ingredients. I have found a few other brands that don't have red-40 but this one is the best tasting one I have tried so far. (it's a bit more expensive, but I think its worth it)"
412,B07S38C5WW,2024-01-13,Melt in your mouth sleep aid,5.0,"These melt in your mouth and are absorbed through the membranes in your mouth. I break them in half, and use as needed. The flavor is good."

It's not always easy to find 5mg melatonin. 10mg is a little too much for me and I wake up a little groggy. This dosage, brand and price point is perfect for me and I'll definitely re-order!"
418,B07S38C5WW,2023-12-14,They do the trick!,5.0,Hubby didn't want to take sleep meds because he's taking plenty of meds already. His sleep specialist suggested using these instead and they've been working quite well.
419,B07S38C5WW,2023-11-11,Only one brand I rely on,5.0,"It’s melting while still in my mouth, that’s how I know it will be absorbed fast. And like many melatonin users I confirm, melatonin is not going to make you fall asleep faster. But the safe nightly routine will. After I’m already in bed and ready to spend 20 mins on my phone, I pop one or two in and bam, brain is signaled. I will be far calmer and ready to switch off for the day."

434,B07S38C5WW,2023-08-30,Contains xylitol,4.0,Beware of this product as it contains xylitol which is fatal even in small amounts to dogs and can be toxic to cats as well. I will no longer be buying this brand in the future but will opt for something unsweetened or differently sweetened. Every time I take one I worry my curious dog is going to to gobble one up if I drop it. Not worth the worry. There are so many other sugar alcohols—or even a small amount of real sugar—that could be used instead. Not sure why xylitol.

It’s a good product, but every once in a while I get a bottle that has a more than acceptable amount that is broken into small pieces. Fortunately, it doesn’t happen too often."
438,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-07,New formula?,4.0,"I've ordered this product 12 times going back several years. The bottle I just received seems to have a new formulation. It dissolves much more slowly and the flavor is reduced. I'm not sure I like it, but it's not the end of the world. I've tried competitors and I really disliked their flavor, so I'll probably stick with this one."

449,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-12,Works Great,5.0,I love this product and have used for a very long time to help me get to sleep . The taste is nice and my grandchildren will even take a small portion of 1 tablet so the taste is kid approved as well & it helps them off to sleep fairly quickly.
450,B07S38C5WW,2023-10-04,Best Melatonin product I have ever used.,5.0,"This is a product that you really should dissolve under your tongue. I takes about 10-15 minutes to work, then you feel ready to sleep! I generally sleep through the entire night!
ps- It tastes great!"
451,B07S38C5WW,2023-08-16,Dissolve on the Tongue & Relax!,5.0,"These little tablets are very effective. Once in a while I have a really hard time sleeping, and I just dissolve 3 or 4 on my tongue, lie down & relax, and in less than 30 minutes I’m off in dreamland. I try not to take them too often, because I read if you take melatonin too regularly, your body will stop making it naturally. But, for occasional sleeplessness, these tablets are really wonderful."
452,B07S38C5WW,2023-10-19,Best tasting chewable,5.0,I’ve been using this brand for years. The effect is consistent and I sleep well using it
453,B07S38C5WW,2021-02-07,These are a MUST TRY for sleepless nights!,5.0,"After trying so many different brands and forms of melatonin, these are- hands down- the best... quality/effectiveness, taste and price. Due to chronic cervical and thoracic spine pain, C-PTSD and major anxiety and depressive disorders, I have a lot of difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep. In an attempt to get this under control without rx medications, I finally found what works best for me. My 21 year old son also takes them and agrees that they are the best tasting and most effective. These tablets start to kick in almost immediately, so be sure to take when you are truly ready to fall asleep- you will become drowsy before turning in and the benefits may wear off by the time you are ready. I take it once I am in bed. They are sweetened with xylitol, so no worries that you already brushed your teeth... xylitol is great for dental health and used in many dental health products. They taste soooo good, too! Unlike a couple of other fast dissolve tablets that I've tried. I sometimes need to take 2, but i start with one. They do also help me stay asleep when I do take them. I use the melatonin as a last resort when meditation, belly breathing, etc doesn't quite do the trick in order to not effect my body's natural melatonin production and to keep from needing an increased dose. I've never experienced groggy mornings from these either and feel well rested when I wake up. The price offered by this seller is outstanding and much lower per tablet for the same product offered by anybody else or anywhere else. Having been out of work for awhile now and unable to return for a few more months, I have to watch every penny that I spend, so I've taken the time to look around and this is the best value by quite a large margin. These melatonin tabs have really been a godsend...such a great product. I highly recommend if you also experience difficulty with sleep!"
454,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-22,Regular purchase,5.0,We purchase this regularly in my house and take some nightly. It really helps to calm the mind and allow for a restful sleep. The taste is pleasant and the price is reasonable - no complaints here.
455,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-03,Can’t live without these !,5.0,I work night shift 5 nights a week 12 hours . I usually take 4 to 6 tabs and get a full days sleep to prepare me for an entire shift . I highly recommend these to anyone having trouble sleeping . 🤷‍♀️
456,B07S38C5WW,2021-03-12,"This specific supplement tastes good, is safe, and helps to fall and stay asleep.",5.0,"So, maybe someone else will laugh, most importantly, I guess is that this 73 years old retired ED nurse has finally stumbled on a supplement that helps me sleep. Been a clinical, and administrative RN for 50 years. I have chased a good nites (or days rest depending on shift worked) since I started college at 17. I’m a stress cadet, not so much anymore, I do miss the ED, my fav department.
Ok, so what is funny, ????? I also have a 2 lb pink feathered friend, my Moluccan, Clyde. Clyde is 11, I am his queen, my husband of 50 years is his nemesis. Clyde is considered a rescue, I found a wonderful aviary in Alabama, Deanie was Clyde’s first mama. Then the evil one adopted him, she was neglectful, and covered him up when he got loud. You can hear these guys from a mile in Malaysia, where the breed is from. I did not know Clyde’s level of anxiety, till a year after he came to live with us. Cockatoo’s are notorious for being dependent, and I think his condition was exacerbated by his adulthood. Anyway, he is a screamer. I researched and found that L theanine, an amino acid, and melatonin has been used as a mild tranquilizer. I found the recommendations for dosage, and he gets 15 mg dissolved in his water every day. A safe dose, diluted. It has brought a more peaceable environment for all who live here including Teddy the resident feral kitty. So, in case you know someone who has a similar screamer problem, you now are aware that it can be manageable. I like this brand, it’s local CA, and it helps me get to sleep, and it helps my birdie baby feel more calm."

462,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-11,My favorite 😍,5.0,This is one of my family's favorite melatonins. They taste delicious and work well for all of us. Recommended.
463,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-12,These tablets dissolve easily in my mouth.,5.0,I love that they dissolve so easily. The flavor is good. There a good value for the money.
464,B07S38C5WW,2023-06-24,They actually work!,5.0,"Like anything, don't use these every day and you'll be fine. Use them every day and they won't work as well because your brain becomes desensitized. First time I took one, I remember waking the next morning and feeling so refreshed! This stuff is awesome. If you're struggling through a bad sleep spell, I recommend switching off between melatonin, nyquil, and benadryl, instead of taking just this. Good luck!"
465,B07S38C5WW,2021-05-29,use for sleep and covid!,5.0,"This is my favorite melatonin. The 5 mg tastes better than the 10. Plus I take 15 mg at night, so it is easy to let 3 dissolve in my mouth when I get into bed. More than 15 mg and I don't get as much deep sleep. (As per my fitbit.) Less than 15 mg and I don't get as much sleep. So you have to fiddle with the dose to get to your sweet spot.

Also my family used this when we had covid. We followed the high dose melatonin protocol. It totally worked. Adults in my house took 80 mg a day in 4 divided doses. (So 20 mg or 4 tablets, four times a day.) We were initially pretty sick but had quick results. We stayed on it for a full two weeks. We never got a cough. I even gave this to my elderly mother in law as a preventative when we had it bc she lived with us. She never got sick but I realized later that she did lose her sense of smell.

This exact product is available cheaper at my big box membership store, but I bought some at amazon when I wasn't able to get to the store.

I love Natrol stuff and buy whatever they sell. I hate to swallow pills and much prefer dissolvable ones. Helpful that it vegan as I have an allergy to meat and cannot have gelatin."
466,B07S38C5WW,2023-01-31,Saved my life,5.0,"I have had bad experiences with melatonin in the past due to higher dosage amounts so I was hesitant to try these. But some recent work schedule changes caused me to need to start waking up at 3AM and naturally I have a hard time falling asleep at a decent time. This caused me some major sleep deprivation.

After purchasing these I started with just half dose of the 5mg and these things are life changing! I was actually able to fall asleep very early and get really good quality of sleep to my surprise. I now always have these on me if I have a hard time falling asleep! It takes me about 15-20 minutes to start feeling sleepy after taking my dose. I will definitely keep purchasing these for a long time."

482,B07S38C5WW,2023-04-08,"LARGER BOTTLE, FEWER TABLETS",5.0,I really like this melatonin because of how easily it dissolves. What I don't like is that it had a more compact bottle with 250 tablets and now the bottle is bigger and has 200 tablets. Makes no sense other than a marketing ploy to make you think you are getting more instead of 1/5 less than before. Boo to incredible shrinking products!!
483,B07S38C5WW,2023-05-25,Sleep,4.0,Sometimes it works sometimes it don’t
484,B07S38C5WW,2020-05-20,Definitely helps during this UNPRECEDENTED time....,5.0,"I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I've been struggling with sorting due to the impact of Covid19. I'm not as active so I'm not sleeping as well. I did lots of research on the benefits of melatonin so I just needed to find the right brand. I went with this brand because it had a high start rating and good reviews... so here's mine:

Taste... like tang.... fake orange flavor, not the best; but not inedible

Dosage...I took advice from a lot of people and decided to start with 5mg ( broke this one in half). Did this for 3 to 4 days and noticed I stayed asleep a little longer. Went up to the full 10mg and went to sleep faster... not knocked out... just eased into it... woke up like clockwork around 630am, refreshed. So I thought I would try 15 mg. Why? Maybe I would go to sleep faster and sleep later. NOPE! I ended waking up every other hour and actually had a dream I could remember.
I've been consistent with 10mg for the past week and it's a good fit. I ease ease into a restful slumber... no more over 😴 and up with a good attitude. My 350lb male friend was knocked out with only 5mg (I'm female, 40, 185 lbs). So I guess it definitely varies with each individual. I say start at 5mg and work up if needed."
485,B07S38C5WW,2023-08-06,These work well,5.0,Take one of these at bedtime and go lay down. Puts you right to sleep. Works well.
486,B07S38C5WW,2023-05-28,A great boost to help you sleep!!,5.0,These chewable sleep aids are the perfect amount of melatonin to help you fall asleep fast and stay asleep longer. They have a wonderful strawberry flavor and are easy to chew with no aftertaste. I would recommend these small tablets if you're looking for a natural way to aid in sleep.

pleasant tasting"
490,B07S38C5WW,2022-07-09,Works great for me,5.0,"No guarantees, but it works great for me, and no hangover in the morning. I know people who tell me melatonin doesn't work for them or they feel loopy in the morning. Too bad. I used to be able to get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep for years, but as I age, my metabolism has changed. My bladder has me having to get up several times in the night to relieve myself, for instance. Before I started taking melatonin, after getting up for the third time, I'd be wide awake and couldn't get back to sleep. With melatonin, this is not a problem - I get back to sleep right away. And like most stuff you buy on Amazon, you get more for less. If you have a problem with sleep, I recommend trying this. I hope it works for you."

494,B07S38C5WW,2023-01-23,Great sleep aid!,5.0,"First of all do not swallow tablet, place one tablet in mouth and let it melt. This is the 5mg tablet my doctor recommended, and he indicated not to take more than 1 tablet each time. I would suggest you contact your doctor if you think you need more than that. I like the fact Melatonin is naturally produced by the human body for sleep. So unless there are any added substances that could be considered harmful, Natrol's Melatonin seems to be safe. Again, for me, my doctor recommended no more than one tablet each time used."

498,B07S38C5WW,2022-11-14,Effective enough,4.0,"Bought this product to help me fall asleep faster as I stay up most of the night. They're fairly easy to swallow and have an alright flavor, like a vitamin. They work fine but not instantly or the most much. For severe night owls there may be something better but I'm not sure. But this product work well enough to go to sleep easily after a small amount of time. Worth the money if it works for you."

506,B07S38C5WW,2024-01-10,Natrol Melatonin 5mg: A Five-Star Sleep Upgrade That Surpasses Expectations,5.0,"Having been a loyal user of the NOW melatonin brand for over a decade, I was hesitant to switch, but trying Natrol Melatonin 5mg has been a revelation, earning it a well-deserved five-star rating.

From the first night, I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of my sleep – a peaceful and restful experience that I hadn't realized was missing. Initially skeptical, I attributed it to a possible fluke, but after consistently using Natrol Melatonin for two bottles now, I can confidently say it's no accident.

The effectiveness of Natrol Melatonin is consistent and reliable, making it an essential part of my nighttime routine. The transition from my previous brand has been seamless, and the positive impact on my sleep has been undeniable.

I wholeheartedly recommend the Natrol Melatonin 5mg to anyone seeking a reliable and effective sleep aid. It has surpassed my expectations, providing the serene and restorative sleep I've been longing for. In my book, it's a five-star game-changer!"

511,B07S38C5WW,2024-01-04,better than others,5.0,"I originally purchased these because I wanted a dissolving pill that did not contain red-40 in the ingredients. I have found a few other brands that don't have red-40 but this one is the best tasting one I have tried so far. (it's a bit more expensive, but I think its worth it)"

Tastes fine and I highly recommend. Side note… have had occasions where I needed to change course and stay awake and was able to push through without a ton of drowsiness. Conclusion when you start to feel sleepy shut it down and let it do its job.

I usually take one about an hour before bedtime, and sleep so much better than I used to. I was a very restless sleeper that would sometimes take hours to fall asleep, but thanks to melatonin I fall asleep easily and get a good restful night's sleep. My one small issue with them is that I wake up a little groggier than usual, but I can usually shake that off after a few minutes."

It's not always easy to find 5mg melatonin. 10mg is a little too much for me and I wake up a little groggy. This dosage, brand and price point is perfect for me and I'll definitely re-order!"

And like many melatonin users I confirm, melatonin is not going to make you fall asleep faster. But the safe nightly routine will. After I’m already in bed and ready to spend 20 mins on my phone, I pop one or two in and bam, brain is signaled. I will be far calmer and ready to switch off for the day."

557,B07S38C5WW,2023-10-08,DIFFERENT FORMULA? STOPPED WORKING.,1.0,"Play Video
 As of September 2023, THIS PRODUCT NO LONGER WORKS.

I have been taking Natrol Melatonin for 5 years. They recently changed the label slightly, and reduced the serving count from 250 to 200…but the worst part is it went from being 100% to 0% effective for me and two of my family members.

It is not kicking in before bed, or in the middle of the night when I wake up and take it. My girlfriend concurs.

It isn’t just me saying this, but my father, who separately subscribes to this product at a different address, concurs. It is not the same as it used to be.

Something may be wrong with the recent manufacturing of this product. I hope they figure it out."
558,B07S38C5WW,2023-10-04,Best Melatonin product I have ever used.,5.0,"This is a product that you really should dissolve under your tongue. I takes about 10-15 minutes to work, then you feel ready to sleep! I generally sleep through the entire night!

Got this bottle and see it now contains wheat. You’re going to get people sick.

This is now useless and a waste of money and time for me I’m going to have to find a different brand."

571,B07S38C5WW,2023-09-08,Caution,1.0,"After using this product I noticed I became extremely itchy and broke out into an allergic reaction, I experienced restlessness, and struggled to sleep. I’ve used other melatonin products without any of these issues before but noticed this product contains far more additives than the ones I usually take. I will not be using these again and encourage everyone to read through the list of ingredients and consider choosing a different product to avoid these very uncomfortable side effects."

578,B07S38C5WW,2023-08-30,Contains xylitol,4.0,Beware of this product as it contains xylitol which is fatal even in small amounts to dogs and can be toxic to cats as well. I will no longer be buying this brand in the future but will opt for something unsweetened or differently sweetened. Every time I take one I worry my curious dog is going to to gobble one up if I drop it. Not worth the worry. There are so many other sugar alcohols—or even a small amount of real sugar—that could be used instead. Not sure why xylitol.

The reviews for this melatonin product were very promising, but I am a skeptic….
I am very happy with this product. I don’t sleep quite as deep as I did with the other, but I do return to a comfortable sleep easily when I have to get up during the night. Fortunately, it doesn’t leave me thick headed in the morning.

Once in a while I have a really hard time sleeping, and I just dissolve 3 or 4 on my tongue, lie down & relax, and in less than 30 minutes I’m off in dreamland. I try not to take them too often, because I read if you take melatonin too regularly, your body will stop making it naturally. But, for occasional sleeplessness, these tablets are really wonderful."

601,B002EA99HE,2023-09-07,Love these,5.0,"I recently started taking NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU, and it has made a noticeable difference in my overall well-being.

The high potency of 5,000 IU per softgel is fantastic, especially for those who may have a Vitamin D deficiency. I appreciate the fact that one softgel provides a significant portion of the daily recommended intake, making it easy to ensure I'm getting enough Vitamin D.

The softgels are easy to swallow, and they don't leave any unpleasant aftertaste. This makes it a hassle-free addition to my daily supplement routine.

I've noticed a positive impact on my mood and energy levels since incorporating this supplement. Vitamin D is crucial for various bodily functions, including immune system support and bone health, and this product delivers in that regard.

The 240-count bottle is excellent value for the price. It lasts for a long time, so I don't have to worry about running out of Vitamin D supplements.

Overall, NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU is a high-quality product that I would recommend to anyone looking to boost their Vitamin D levels. It's convenient, effective, and offers great value for the quantity provided. It's become a staple in my supplement regimen."
602,B002EA99HE,2023-12-07,Small and powerful,5.0,I’m on my second bottle of these they’re nice and small and loaded with vitamin D. This is a reliable company so I pretty much only buy from them and a few others but I’m always pleased with NOW. They always have great prices too!
603,B002EA99HE,2023-11-16,Good value for product,5.0,"What I like is the high potency for a small pill that is easily swallowed. Many other brands have reviews where the pills are all stuck together, these pills don't have that issue. They are all separable. The Now brand is cheaper than others so I was worried about quality. I saw one reviewer mention that they were informed by someone in the industry that they are pretty good so I went for it. Sure enough, pretty good."
604,B002EA99HE,2024-01-04,Great product,5.0,Great product at a fair price
605,B002EA99HE,2023-09-28,all seem to work the same,4.0,"I need to take vitamin D due to low levels in my body. It serves its purpose, is easy to swallow and the price was reasonable. This bottle that I purchased in 2023 had the expiration date of 2027. Since I take it daily I have no fear of using up the 120 pills in around 4 years time. I personally have not noticed a difference from one brand to another in my blood work."
606,B002EA99HE,2023-12-27,Works Great!,5.0,I love that it's made with olive oil and not a crappy seed oil. Small capsule and easy to swallow with no taste!

608,B002EA99HE,2023-12-23,Vitamin D levels good,5.0,Very convenient vitamin D3 supplement. It contains a large dose of vitamin in a very tiny and easy to swallow pill. This vitamin needs to be taken with some fat to be better absorbed so the fact that this pill is oil based makes it perfect.

You barely feel it, and it's kind of slippery so it doesn't get ""stuck,"" nor does it have a weird vitamin-y taste that bothers you for a while after. For these reasons, this is the D3 my family and I continue to repurchase."
610,B002EA99HE,2024-01-10,"Good product, inconsistent look.",5.0,"I've purchased these for my hubby 3 times, and each time the pills look different. One time the gel cap is clear, next time they're white. Dr's tests show his levels are staying steady, so no complaints about the results, just a bit concerning when the look keeps changing. Makes me wonder why."
611,B002EA99HE,2024-01-16,Take once a week,4.0,"I'm surprised the direction does not say to take these once a week. This is the strongest potency there is and it shouldn't be taken everyday nor for a long period. It can only be taken up to 6-8 weeks once per week. My first day of taken them I got a headache. Second week no headache, I think my body got used to the first capsule."
612,B002EA99HE,2024-01-17,Great value,5.0,Now is my favorite brand and the pricing here on Amazon is amazing as opposed to going to a local vitamin store

614,B002EA99HE,2023-12-24,Really works,5.0,"My doctor asked after blood work why I was taking so much vitamin E. She suggested I back off. The assistant motioned to keep talking it! I heard that it is good and I continue to take 5,000 units a day."
615,B002EA99HE,2023-12-23,"No taste, easy to swallow",5.0,Flavorless and easy to swallow. I take this after a meal with my vitamin B12 and I do not have an issue with being cold all the time anymore. My energy levels are higher and I have been sleeping better.

664,B002EA99HE,2012-11-21,Vitamin D-3,5.0,"itamin D3 deficiency is common in older adults and has been implicated in psychiatric and neurologic disorders. For example, in one study of 80 older adults (40 with mild Alzheimer’s disease and 40 nondemented persons), Vitamin D3 deficiency was associated with low mood and with impairment on two of four measures of cognitive performance.6

Back Pain

Musculoskeletal disorders have been linked to Vitamin D3 deficiency in a number of studies. One of the newest studies explored the role that low Vitamin D3 levels play in the development of chronic low back pain in women. Sixty female patients in Egypt complaining of low back pain lasting more than three months were studied. Researchers measured levels of Vitamin D3 in the women with low back pain and compared those levels to those of 20 matched healthy controls.

The study revealed that patients with low back pain had significantly lower Vitamin D3 levels than controls. Low Vitamin D3 levels (25 OHD < 40 ng/ml) were found in 49/60 patients (81 percent) and 12/20 (60 percent) of controls.7

Bone Health

One of the best known and long-established benefits of Vitamin D3 is its ability to improve bone health and the health of the musculoskeletal system. It is well documented that Vitamin D3 deficiency causes osteopenia, precipitates and exacerbates osteoporosis, causes a painful bone disease known as osteomalacia, and exacerbates muscle weakness, which increases the risk of falls and fractures. Vitamin D3 insufficiency may alter the regulatory mechanisms of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and cause a secondary hyperparathyroidism that increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.8

Cognitive Enhancement

Scientists are developing a greater appreciation for Vitamin D3’s ability to improve cognition. In a recent study, Vitamin D3 deficient subjects scored worse on mental function tests compared to individuals who had higher levels of the Vitamin.9 The researchers wrote, “In conclusion, the positive, significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D concentration and MMSE [mental state examination scores] in these patients suggests a potential role for Vitamin D in cognitive function of older adults.”

Immunity

Scientists have linked various aspects of immune health to a Vitamin D3 deficiency. Vitamin D3 regulates T cells, which are important to the functioning of a strong immune system. Vitamin D3 acts as an immune system modulator, preventing excessive expression of inflammatory cytokines and increasing the killing efficiency of macrophages. In addition, it dramatically stimulates the expression of potent anti-microbial peptides, which exist in immune system cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer cells, and in cells lining the respiratory tract. These Vitamin-D3-stimulated peptides play a major role in protecting the lung from infection.13

In addition, Vitamin D3 deficiency may influence development and progression of various autoimmune diseases.14

Multi-Talented Nutrient

Vitamin D3 deficiency has been linked to a host of other conditions such as high blood pressure, fibromyalgia, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and an increased risk of pre-eclampsia and insulin resistance during pregnancy.11,15-16 Most recently, low Vitamin D3 levels have been linked to an increased prevalence of early age-related macular degeneration.17

Proper Dosage

In many of my patients, even after consuming 2,000 to 4,000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day, their test results indicate that their Vitamin D3 levels have not increased. These patients needed to consume 8,000 IU of Vitamin D3 per day to achieve proper blood levels of the Vitamin. Patients should, therefore, have their physicians test their serum 1,25-dihyroxy D3 levels to determine the proper level of supplementation required. Testing is very important due to the fact that, in a small number of patients, Vitamin D3 supplementation can raise calcium levels to an excessively high level. I have found this to be especially true in African American patients. Testing for 1,25-dihyroxy Vitamin D3, PTH and calcium blood levels should therefore become a part of every woman’s regular blood work.

Conclusion

A growing number of researchers who have widely studied Vitamin D3 are almost begging the general public to consume more of this important nutrient. Due to Vitamin D3’s high safety profile in doses up to 10,000 IU per day and because of the wide role it plays in our health, consuming 2,000 to 4,000 IU per day of this nutrient at times of the year when sunlight is scarce is a prudent way to improve overall health."

673,B002EA99HE,2017-11-11,Because the MK-7 from Natto makes me itch like crazy and makes me feel sick,5.0,"It seems that 1,000 IU of vitamin D3 will raise your blood levels by 5 ng/mL. At least in my case.

My Vitamin D level was 18 ng/mL. I took 20,000 UI of Vitamin D for 2 weeks and then I increase it to 40,000 UI for 4 weeks and my levels went up to 136.3 ng/mL. The reference range for Vitamin D is 30-80 ng/mL (this is the normal-range lower and upper limits) so my levels were HIGH. An increase of about 3 ng/mL per 1,000 UI of Vitamin D supplementation in a very short period of time so if I took it for longer (8 weeks) I will guess it will be a lot higher. I took that much because I am supposed to not be able to absorb it because I am supposedly not generation enough stomach acid and taking ursodiol which affects the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, I was wrong…

When I was taking a supplement with 2,000 UI of Vitamin D my level was 30 ng/mL when I stopped taking it my level went down to 18 ng/mL. An increase of about 5 ng/mL per 1,000 UI

I want to be at 70 ng/mL (which is the hight end of the optimal level) because I have autoimmune thyroid disease and autoimmune gastritis. So to go from 18 ng/mL to 70 ng/mL (raise my levels by 50), I should have taken 10,000 IU of Vitamin D and not 40,000 IU as I did.

Just in case you did not know, the Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) you take is converted by the liver into calcifediol (a prehormone) also know as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This is the substance that is measure when you take a vitamin D test. So if your liver is not working properly or you are taking medicines that affect the liver your absorption will vary. After it is converted by the liver, it then needs to be converted to the active form our body can use and this is done by the kidneys. The active form is called calcitriol. So again if you kidneys are not working well, your blood levels might be high but you are in reality still deficient because your kidneys can’t convert it to the active form. There is a test to measure calcitriol too but is not given often.

I am going to start taking 10,000 UI now along with Vitamin K2 but I will wait 10 days as my levels are too high now.

Vitamin K2 is a must if you are going to maintain your vitamin-D Levels in the high end of the optimal range. I use the Menatetrenone (also know as MK-4 form) form of Vitamin K2 (check Wikipedia). Why? Because the MK-7 from Natto makes me itch like crazy and makes me feel sick. Also, Menatetrenone/MK-4 is the type use in Japan to treat osteoporosis. I am using the Thorne brand and I buy it here in amazon. Just in case you are curious the dosage to treat osteoporosis with Vitamin K2 (as Menatetrenone) in Japan is 15 mg, three times daily. That is exactly the high end of the suggested dosage mention in Thorne Vitamin K2 Liquid. I only wish Thorne had a softgel form of this supplement so I can place it in my pill holder. Carlson also makes this form of Vitamin K2 but is not liquid. It is a dry powder. I do not like that because K2 needs fat to be absorved and the Thorne brand is dissolved in Medium Chain Triglycerides (oil).

I am going to update this review at 8 weeks after I have my Vitamin D levels tested again."

676,B002EA99HE,2018-12-06,Very important vitamin as we age,5.0," [+] WHITE GLOVE REVIEW w/ video
(To watch the video or upvote review goto: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24WTEVRR04JRA)
=>Vitamin D-3 is produced by the skin when exposed to sun light. As we age, our skin becomes less effective at producing this critical vitamin. I am an older person, so I could spend all day in the sun and still not be getting enough D-3. I take this to supplement my body to make sure I am getting enough D-3. I have read literature that follows a guideline of supplementing with around 2,000 IU after the age of 35 and around 5,000 IU after the age of 50. I follow this guideline, which is why I take 5,000 IU. There are many manufacturers now that sell D-3, and I am sure that many are good. I buy the NOW brand because I trust this company to give me the highest quality for the most reasonable price. I don’t buy everything from NOW Foods, because I assess each product as to what company I should buy from.

[+] INGREDIENTS
Active:
- Vitamin D3 as Cholecalciferol from Lanolin (125mg : 5000IU : 625%DV)
Other:
- Softgel Capsule (bovine gelatin, water, glycerin) and Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

[+] WHAT TO EXPECT
Vitamin D-3 is not a vitamin that will give you an effect for the most part. I have heard about some people who find their skin to become softer or other such mild effects. But, for the most part, I take D-3 because my body needs it to function properly, not because any symptom I am having. Think of Vitamin D-3 like putting oil in your car. For the most part, even if your car is low in oil, it runs just fine. That’s why we check it with a dip stick otherwise who would know. But, if you run your car low in oil long enough, then symptoms will appear. However, then it’s too late. The damage to your car has already been done. That’s how I think about taking D-3. It’s something that needs to be maintained, but if it’s not, then your body will eventually break down in some way – and as with the car, then its too late.

[+] USAGE/DOSE
The suggested usage (from the label) is to, “Take 1 softgel every 2 days with a fat-containing meal, or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.” I take one softgel per day; however, there are days that I skip taking it. I am not advocating to deviate from the product’s suggested use; I am only conveying what I do. On average, I most likely take this product 4-5 times a week. If I forget to take this product (along with my multi-vitamin) for more than a couple of days, I usually take two the first day.

696,B002EA99HE,2022-07-07,Extremely Important Vitamin D3 That’s Affordable!,5.0,"My Endocrinologist had advised that I needed to start taking a vitamin supplement after they had ran labs on me. It was found that my Vitamin D3 level was a bit below normal. I'm in my mid-years, and I used to be a very active person outside. But, as my life has changed over the years, I find myself spending more time inside now. As being as such, it wasn’t surprising to learn that my Vitamin D3 levels had begun to suffer. As directed by my doctor, I started taking one vitamin d3 supplement daily — NOW brand softgels. After only about a month, low and behold, I was starting to feel better than I had in a really long time. I stated to have more energy, I wasn't falling asleep during the day anymore, and I was able to do my daily exercises with a bit more ease. My doctor ran those exact same labs again after I had taken almost the full bottle, my level was much higher than before. I was told it's going to take a while to get things back to normal, but I can definitely tell its working. NOW brand vitamin D3 supplement seems to be offered at a little better price than most others on the market. This is an amazing and affordable vitamin supplement that is easy to swallow by mouth and by your pocket financially. Always ask your doctor before deciding to start or stop a vitamin supplement regimen. Listening to my doctors about needing to take specific vitamin supplements has really turned my life around."
697,B002EA99HE,2023-10-09,They’re small and easy to swallow,5.0,I hope these are doing what they need to do inside me. I guess my next blood test will tell.
698,B002EA99HE,2023-08-08,Possible vitamin d3 deficiencies,5.0,I've been in pain for so long. So joints and leg bone pain is unbearable at times. 2 orthopedic doctors tell me to get rotator cup surgery another doctor says it's with getting older each year. All these doctors give pain killers. None work. I found out just by going outside into the sunshine and taking this d3 supplements. The unbearable pain goes completely away. I still have pain from time to time. But the pain is becoming unnoticeable
699,B002EA99HE,2021-08-22,Now is a great brand and 5000 the size for not small people - 4th bottles YES YES A++,5.0,"Vit D is essential to health. Sun isn't enough for ideal or all norther areas. Vit-D is a hormone that modulates over 100 genes and is essential for health. Poor Immune system is VERY CLOSELY TIED to low Vid-D.. Animals have a pathway to make their own. The UK has national health and thus GREAT DATA on 30 million people. Alarming Vit-D levels are seen in Northern areas.. 2016 peer reviewed study showed 70% the population are below IDEAL levels and 30% below target. DARK skin people blocks sunlight and they mostly below target levels. CLINICALLY DANGEROUS less than 10% of target is not uncommon. They take this seriously. Others studies show resistance to FLU's and especially repretory illness have HUGE Improvements. There are Studies for this years bug .. Look it up. It's a taboo subject here. Healthcare will not recommend above 1000iu because of the TINY people and a couple medical issues. LARGE weekly, monthly and 6 mo doses are HUGE by comparison and Given to massive people in many places. Levels dip in just 3 days so infrequent is less ideal.. No MD doctor in USA or UK would tell you taking 1 (5000iu) a week was dangerous. YMMV . do some research.
Before you complain.. FREE healthcare for USA> There is NO PROFIT in UK healthcare, people are paid poorly, facilities are beat up old buildings, safety is minimal, there are no lawsuits, CARE is RATIONED.. At a certain age you will not be treated for cancer and 20 other things. Low health or Years of life left score, you are maintenance only."

My blood test shows that I’m below normal in the D vitamin even though I’ve been taking them for over a year. I may miss a day or two but that should not affect the results since they are much higher potency than needed.

I will switch to another brand and see what happens but for now, I am done with using NOW products."

746,B002EA99HE,2023-12-10,NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 - A Constipated Odyssey,3.0,"So, I thought I'd be all ""health ninja"" and grab NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU. Note to self: Next time, consult a doctor, unless you're into surprise constipation parties. Spoiler alert: I wasn't.

These golden nuggets of ""structural support"" turned out to be more like rebellious architects staging a coup in my digestive system. Forget about feeling the sunshine; I was stuck in a cloud of discomfort.

Now, did I experience any life-altering revelations during this constipation escapade? Nope. These softgels didn't transform me into a health god; they just made me question my life choices while glued to the porcelain throne.

In the grand spectacle of my health journey, these softgels decided to add a plot twist. ""Sure, boost your Vitamin D levels,"" they whispered, ""but we're also here to keep things interesting, like a dysfunctional reality show for your gut.""

So, if you're in the market for a supplement that turns your daily routine into a bathroom drama, NOW Supplements Vitamin D-3 5,000 IU might just be your quirky sidekick. As for me, I'm off to consult professionals before embarking on any more gut-wrenching adventures. Here's to health, humor, and the uncharted territories of constipation comedy!"

However, these have become impossible for me to open due to normal advancing age, natural thinning of my skin on my fingers and hands. I must to other brands of supplements that have the more normal twist-off plastic cap opening-and-closing that goes much smoother, nicer, better and easier for their elderly customers. Seems to me that NOW supplements would learn to acommodate their elderly customers in order to KEEP these former customers. Many of us who live in our 55+ gated communities would be grateful."

I reordered the other day and NOW has, for whatever reason, added safflower oil, which if I'm not mistaken is a seed oil and bad news.

Recomiendo completamente esta segunda opción. La ingesta diaria me estaba generando un brote fuerte en la piel (cara, espalda, etc.) que solo se disipó cuando suspendí el medicamento. Ahora tomo la pastilla una vez cada 8 días y no he visto estos efectos. Algo para tomar en cuenta: leí que ""a menos que su médico lo recomiende, evite tomar más de 4000 UI por día"".

The other day I saw the same brand and exact same bottle at the 99 cent store lol for $2.99 or 3.99. Will buy it there next time. I don’t like paying triple the price for something"
793,B002EA99HE,2023-10-13,doctor recommened,5.0,"Doctor rcommended after a deficency was noted on labs tests. I like the now brand due to being gluetn and dairy free.

801,B07GSGWZMB,2023-08-04,So far so good!!,5.0,"I just started taking these and have felt a difference in joint pain and my back pain. No fishy taste or burps, but if you stick your nose in the bottle it does smell fishy but it is supposed to. Not a huge deal for me as long as it helps. They are easy to swallow and I have started off just taking one capsule daily to see if that is enough. If not after a week or so I will bump it up to 2 daily. I do recommend these and they are a good price for krill."

803,B07GSGWZMB,2023-09-21,Broken Capsule,4.0,"I’ve been taking these for a couple of years and not sure if they have helped or not. I stopped a few times and didn't notice a difference. My latest bottle had a broken capsule and all the other capsules are oily and smell awful not to mention the taste. Trying to get through the bottle, but I gag a little every time. I know others see a difference, so I may keep taking and hope that the next bottle is fully in tact."
804,B07GSGWZMB,2023-10-24,"If you get heartburn from fish oil, TRY THESE",5.0,"I've tried many fish oil and krill oil pills, trying to find something that doesn't give me heartburn but still provides omega 3. This is the best I've found. No fishy smell, no weird aftertastes or burps.

The only issue I found, and others have echoed, is that all my pills were fused together fr the desert heat. After they cooled down, I simply smacked the bottle around and most of them broke apart. A couple stayed stuck together (and some broke when I tried to force them apart), but all I'm all I'm very pleased with this brand!"
805,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-05,Krill oil is the best to buy!!,5.0,"Haven’t used it yet, but I know my regular Nature Made fish oil is good, but I’ve always heard that Krill oil is much better!"

807,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-07,Burping up nasty fish taste,3.0,"I bought these Krill supplements because they are supposed to be good at lowering cholesterol. I’ve just starting taking them so I can’t speak to that yet. However a big reason I chose this brand is because people said there was no fish taste or burping up a fish taste. That’s not true. Everytime I take one I am burping up a terrible fish taste. It’s really awful. I hope they work for the purpose I bought them, but this fish taste is a bummer. 3 stars because of the fish taste."

The first bottle of 240 softgels I ordered in the summer of 2023 was very good, and I had no problems using the capsules daily. With the second order of 120 soft gels I ordered in December I was not so lucky. A couple of capsules had apparently leaked and all the gelsl capsules are stuck together. Tried separating them but they just burst. So I'm out the cost of a bottle of these Krill Oil gels and unfortunately I might have to reconsider what I order in the future."

However on the main listing page it says “eligible for return”. What I didn’t know was that when you click on Eligible for return under the listing, it THEN says nonreturnable. Very deceptive and can’t get my money back. Listing needs to be clearer about eligibility for return"

832,B07GSGWZMB,2023-04-16,Does the trick for me!,5.0,"I was having a lot of leg swelling because of sitting for hours... I need both of my hips replaced and am waiting for a surgery date... Ho hum??? I had read other customers who purchased this product say that their leg swelling was in decline from taking this Krill Oil... It took about two weeks but my swelling started going down and now I can see the veins and bones in my feet again, even my calves are showing vain and no real swelling. After 2 months I have now purchased another bottle... Overall, I feel That Krill oil is superiors to fish oil for this purpose and recommend others with swelling try it!

I'm a believer now and will stay on the regimen I now use... 2 soft gels every 2 days seems to work, as well there is other health benefits for the use of this oil and I'm keeping an eye on my blood labs to see if they change over time in the good and bad cholesterol Zone...So far it seems to be helping in that area too!

841,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-14,All stuck together and went horribly rancid fast,2.0,"Same as many others here, first bottle no problem, but the second one showed up as one lump all glued together. I’ve plucked the pills apart as I’ve used them, but then they got so rancid my bedroom fills with the odor of long dead and rotting fish each time I open the bottle. Stopped taking them obviously and now they sit on my shelf as a monument to years past when I used to visit the shores of Lake Michigan after a mass fish die off in spring. Imagine a dead whale carcass poised for months on the beach during a climate change Arctic summer. You get the idea. I think I will not order these any more. Statins will do. I’m old. I ache. It is nature’s way and I’m going with the flow from here on out."
842,B07GSGWZMB,2023-07-14,Rarely fishy,4.0,These are large pills that are somewhat easy to swallow. The thing I like best about though is the lack of fish aftertaste that I have had with other fish oil supplements.
843,B07GSGWZMB,2023-10-15,Effective,5.0,"Use this as part of my heart health regimen. I take in the mornings because sometimes it gives me indigestion. Overall, it works great. No bad after taste and easy to swallow."
844,B07GSGWZMB,2022-09-11,Nature’s Supplement,5.0,"I wanted to write this review for a couple of reasons. First of all, A few years ago I was told by my specialist to take Fish Oil for a condition. I did some research and found Krill Oil was at least comparable to fish oil, as it high in Omega 3 fatty acid. I figured if blue whales could take it, so could I. I have been taking Krill Oil for about 5 years, and this particular product for about 3 years. It is the best price. I have no side effects. Occasionally I will be able to have a fishy taste in my mouth. Everyone’s body reacts differently to anything you ingest. You need to realize you are taking fish oil - it will not taste like chocolate! It is a larger pill, but it is 1000mg, so you can get the most benefits from that dosage. I never get headaches, and I also notice that I do not get body aches or swelling. I’m a runner and run 3-4 times per week. I attribute this supplement with helping maintain my body, and slowing the progression of my condition. I have not regretted using this and my body has become accustomed to its addition. No supplement will ever cure you of anything, but with proper life choices and this as an addition, it can add to a healthy life."
845,B07GSGWZMB,2023-09-09,Quality product.,5.0,"I read about Krill oil online. I found these on Amazon and had to buy them.
They are not overly expensive. But honestly I'm not sure I can tell I'm taking
them. It might take 30 days before any difference shows up. It might be the
fact I'm 72. I might just have waited too long.

853,B07GSGWZMB,2023-09-25,Broken capsules,3.0,My krill oil arrived on time but when I opened them a handful of my capsules were broken and the liquid spilled out over the other pills. This has made many of them stick together and they break when forcing them apart. And if you are familiar will krill oil it smells fishy so my bottle really smells when I open it.
854,B07GSGWZMB,2023-01-20,This Worked for Me!,5.0,"I began taking these 3 months ago. My overall cholesterol at the time was 203. At the time I was already on a low dose statin with another brand of fish oil along with a low fat diet. My doctor told me that he was concerned. I told him to give me 3 months to come back for a follow up with blood work. He agreed. The only thing that I changed was the fish oil which guided me to this product. Three months passed and I went back for my lab work. A week later my doctor saw me for follow up. My overall cholesterol was 170!! My doctor told me to keep taking these fish oil supplements but never more than once daily. He didn’t increase the statin dose either. These gel pills have a fishy smell, and are bigger than most. I take mine after lunch and have no fish tasting burps afterwards. I just ordered another bottle of these. Everyone is different with their results, but I have finally found something that works!"

I'm 70 and have rheumatoid arthritis in my tail bone. I've tried turmeric and many other joint supplements with no results. I enjoy riding my motorcycle but it got where I couldn't go more than an hour without extreme pain. I haven't even gone through half a bottle of this krill oil and now can ride two hours and only get moderate pain. Hoping for more improvement with longer use."
856,B07GSGWZMB,2023-09-11,Fresh catch?,3.0,"I gave a 3 star because I bought this brand 12 times (as opposed to a 1 star). This is the first time that I am having issues with it and trying to get through the bottle. I have never tasted the fish until now. Has the formula changed? It is very fishy. I'm trying to stay loyal, but Mega red looks good to me every time I take this."

859,B07GSGWZMB,2022-08-06,"No real complaints, seems high quality, honest review",4.0,"I was experiencing swollen ankles and I heard krill oil helps circulation and can reduce ankle swelling. I have been taking these for a few weeks and my swelling is almost down to zero. That being said, at the same time I made other lifestyle changes, such as quitting drinking, no sugar, no gluten, and a general keto style diet. Are these pills contributing to my well-being? I can't say for sure, but I have been feeling better since making changes, and these pills were part of my change. One comment I want to be bluntly honest about is the strong taste and aroma. They do have an aftertaste of fish, and at times I can smell a strong krill oil odor when I urinate, or sometimes I'll wake up and taste krill, which goes away by brushing teeth and using mouthwash. As far as long term health improvement, time will tell."
860,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-10,Where’s the higher EPA and DHA?,2.0,I’m disappointed to find a low amount of EPA and DHA considering its 2000mg of Krill Oil. I’ve had 1000 mg with much more then this 2000 mg. The EPA in this one is 80 mg but others offer EPA of 135 for 1000 mg of Krill oil. Where is the benefit of more milligrams? I’m disappointed. I should have looked closer but I assumed it would have been better then a 1000 mg krill oil.
861,B07GSGWZMB,2023-07-20,Great Producy,5.0,I was having issues with my feet and ankles swollen so I read the reviews and saw that it had help customers with swelling. I purchase it a week and a half ago and started using it and my feet haven’t had any swelling and also some of the pain is gone. I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it.
862,B07GSGWZMB,2023-06-27,Great Omega 3’s,5.0,Doctor recommended Omega 3’s and I’ve notice a difference since I started taking these daily. Moving from PNW to Arizona changed my diet. I love seafood! Here it’s not as easy to get. And more expensive with the shipping. I noticed a difference and after speaking to doctor started taking this Krill Oil and last blood work and checkup was told to continue doing whatever I am doing…so highly recommend this Krill Oil supplements for Omega 3’s and a healthy body.

864,B07GSGWZMB,2023-11-23,Instead of 120 Krill Oil Pills I Got One Huge Stuck Together Pill,1.0,"Not happy at all with Antarctic Krill Oil Pills by Carlyle. Instead of getting 120 gel cap pills I got on giant stuck together pill which I guess is meant for King Kong to make sure he’s getting his Omega 3 in.

I had to get an ice pick to drill down into the bottle breaking a few gel caps so I could dump them in my hand. The problem with doing that is I pierced several pills causing a big red Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.

I would like a replacement to see if it was just an unlucky bottle or I deserve to get my money back. I’ve been buying Kori Krill Oil and have never had an issue. I guess I should stick with what’s worked for me in the past.

Besides taking Krill Oil on a daily basis I also take a Tablespoon of Carlson Fish Oil along with 3 Tablespoons of Gaea Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I take a Tablespoon and a half in the morning along with my Carlson Fish Oil and another Tablespoon and a half of EVOO 30 minutes before dinner. I’m big into heart health adding 45 minutes of Cardio and 30 minutes or weight or resistance training 6 or 7 days a week. I don’t automatically take a day off. I listen to my body and if I feel tired or sore I may take a day off but the problem is I feel so good I rarely take that rest day. It does as much for my mental state as it does for my physical state."

875,B07GSGWZMB,2022-12-30,Fishy pill,4.0,"I bought this brand because it was way cheaper than Native Path brand. Very fishy smell and for an hour after taking it (even with a full meal), you have fish burps. Easy to swallow and a fraction of the price of other brands. Does the same thing as the expensive brands but the fish burps almost made me gag. On a positive note, it keeps my feet from swelling so much."

For a reliable and effective Omega-3 and astaxanthin supplement, I highly recommend Antarctic Krill Oil 2000 mg softgels."

902,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-14,All stuck together and went horribly rancid fast,2.0,"Same as many others here, first bottle no problem, but the second one showed up as one lump all glued together. I’ve plucked the pills apart as I’ve used them, but then they got so rancid my bedroom fills with the odor of long dead and rotting fish each time I open the bottle. Stopped taking them obviously and now they sit on my shelf as a monument to years past when I used to visit the shores of Lake Michigan after a mass fish die off in spring. Imagine a dead whale carcass poised for months on the beach during a climate change Arctic summer. You get the idea. I think I will not order these any more. Statins will do. I’m old. I ache. It is nature’s way and I’m going with the flow from here on out."

906,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-10,Where’s the higher EPA and DHA?,2.0,I’m disappointed to find a low amount of EPA and DHA considering its 2000mg of Krill Oil. I’ve had 1000 mg with much more then this 2000 mg. The EPA in this one is 80 mg but others offer EPA of 135 for 1000 mg of Krill oil. Where is the benefit of more milligrams? I’m disappointed. I should have looked closer but I assumed it would have been better then a 1000 mg krill oil.

I’ve just starting taking them so I can’t speak to that yet. However a big reason I chose this brand is because people said there was no fish taste or burping up a fish taste. That’s not true. Everytime I take one I am burping up a terrible fish taste. It’s really awful. I hope they work for the purpose I bought them, but this fish taste is a bummer. 3 stars because of the fish taste."
910,B07GSGWZMB,2024-01-05,Oily residue covering all the softgels,2.0,There must have been a busted or leaky softgel in the bottle because there was oily residue and pieces of broken pills all within the bottle .

The first bottle of 240 softgels I ordered in the summer of 2023 was very good, and I had no problems using the capsules daily. With the second order of 120 soft gels I ordered in December I was not so lucky. A couple of capsules had apparently leaked and all the gelsl capsules are stuck together. Tried separating them but they just burst. So I'm out the cost of a bottle of these Krill Oil gels and unfortunately I might have to reconsider what I order in the future."

I tried to separate them with a spoon but they didn't budge and I didn't want krill oil dripping all over in the bottle. When I went to try to return it I was told on the site non returnable. No place to ask for replacement so I am trying this way to complain."

941,B07GSGWZMB,2023-11-23,Instead of 120 Krill Oil Pills I Got One Huge Stuck Together Pill,1.0,"Not happy at all with Antarctic Krill Oil Pills by Carlyle. Instead of getting 120 gel cap pills I got on giant stuck together pill which I guess is meant for King Kong to make sure he’s getting his Omega 3 in.

I had to get an ice pick to drill down into the bottle breaking a few gel caps so I could dump them in my hand. The problem with doing that is I pierced several pills causing a big red Exxon Valdez Oil Spill.

I would like a replacement to see if it was just an unlucky bottle or I deserve to get my money back. I’ve been buying Kori Krill Oil and have never had an issue. I guess I should stick with what’s worked for me in the past.

Besides taking Krill Oil on a daily basis I also take a Tablespoon of Carlson Fish Oil along with 3 Tablespoons of Gaea Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I take a Tablespoon and a half in the morning along with my Carlson Fish Oil and another Tablespoon and a half of EVOO 30 minutes before dinner. I’m big into heart health adding 45 minutes of Cardio and 30 minutes or weight or resistance training 6 or 7 days a week. I don’t automatically take a day off. I listen to my body and if I feel tired or sore I may take a day off but the problem is I feel so good I rarely take that rest day. It does as much for my mental state as it does for my physical state."

I don't know what they did, but they drastically changed this product. As soon as I opened the bottle, it had this terrible fishy smell which wasn't ever present in my previous purchases and not only that, now it has a terrible fishy after taste.
So, I immediately go to return this product just to discover it does not qualify for returns. So, they got one over on me and lost a customer in the process. I'll never purchase this product again after this experience! If a bad fishy smell and after taste don't appeal to you, I would suggest looking elsewhere for you krill oil from here on out!"
