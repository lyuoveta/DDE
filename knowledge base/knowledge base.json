They were also shown to downregulate adrenal peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and increase adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. Ginkgo biloba also reversibly inhibits monoamine oxidase A; and modestly inhibits anticholinesterase activity, leading to enhanced cholinergic transmission in the brain",

  "Generic name": "Vitamin D3",
  "Synonyms": "Vitamin D3, cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol",
  "Pharmacology": "The main two biologically active forms of vitamin D are produced in two steps in the body. First, vitamin D3 undergoes hydroxylation in the liver to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and then it undergoes another hydroxylation in the kidneys to generate 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. These vitamin D metabolites help in calcium and phosphorus absorption in the small intestine, leading to an increase in serum calcium and phosphate levels, promoting bone mineralization. They also aid in mobilizing calcium and phosphate from bones and potentially increase calcium and phosphate reabsorption through the kidneys. There is a delay of 10 to 24 hours between the administration of cholecalciferol and its effects in the body due to the need for synthesis of active vitamin D metabolites in the liver and kidneys. The regulation of this metabolism at the renal level is controlled by parathyroid hormone",
  "Action serving ": "Treatment of refractory rickets, hypoparathyroidism, and familial hypophosphatemia, as well as osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease.",
  "For whom": "To treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency, for weak and brittle bones, heart disease, asthma, hay fever",

  "Compatibility": "Certain medications can make it harder for your body to absorb vitamin D. If you take other medications, take them at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after you take cholecalciferol",
  "For special groups (pregnant, breastfeeding, children, elderly)": "Special risks:\n- Heart disease\n- Kidney disease\n- Electrolyte imbalance",
  "Side effects": "Hives, difficult breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue or throat; fever, chills, body aches, flu symptoms; chest pain, uneven heartbeats. Less serious side effects: back pain, mild skin rash, fishy aftertaste or belching in some patients"
